道可道

非常名  
無名天地之始  
有名萬物之母  
故常無欲  
以觀其妙  
常有欲以觀其徼  
此兩者同出而異名

同謂之玄  
玄之又玄

The way that can be spoken of   
Is not the constant way;   
The name that can be named   
Is not the constant name.    
<br>
The nameless was the beginning of heaven and earth;   
The named was the mother of the myriad creatures.    
<br>
Hence always rid yourself of desires in order to observe its secrets;   
But always allow yourself to have desires in order to observe its manifestations.    
<br>
These two are the same   
But diverge in name as they issue forth.   
Being the same they are called mysteries,   
Mystery upon mystery -   
The gateway of the manifold secrets.

天下皆知美之爲美  
斯惡已  
皆知善之爲善  
斯不善已  
故有無相生  
難易相成  
長短相較  
高下相傾  
音聲相和  
前後相隨  
是以聖人處無爲之事  
行不言之教  
萬物作焉而不辭  
生而不有  
爲而不恃  
功成而弗居  
夫唯弗居  
是以不去

The whole world recognizes the beautiful as the beautiful, yet this is only the ugly;   
the whole world recognizes the good as the good, yet this is only the bad.    
<br>
Thus Something and Nothing produce each other;   
The difficult and the easy complement each other;   
The long and the short off-set each other;   
The high and the low incline towards each other;   
Note and sound harmonize with each other;   
Before and after follow each other.    
<br>
Therefore the sage keeps to the deed that consists in taking no action and practises the teaching that uses no words.    
<br>
The myriad creatures rise from it yet it claims no authority;   
It gives them life yet claims no possession;   
It benefits them yet exacts no gratitude;   
It accomplishes its task yet lays claim to no merit.    
<br>
It is because it lays claim to no merit   
That its merit never deserts it.

不尚賢  
使民不爭  
不貴難得之貨  
使民不爲盜    
<br>
不見可欲  
使民心不亂  
是以聖人之治  
虛其心

常使民無知無欲  
使夫智者不敢爲也

Not to honor men of worth will keep the people from contention;   
not to value goods which are hard to come by will keep them from theft;   
not to display what is desirable will keep them from being unsettled of mind.    
<br>
Therefore in governing the people, the sage empties their minds but fills their bellies, weakens their wills but strengthens their bones.   
He always keeps them innocent of knowledge and free from desire, and ensures that the clever never dare to act.    
<br>
Do that which consists in taking no action, and order will prevail.

The way is empty, yet use will not drain it.   
Deep, it is like the ancestor of the myriad creatures.    
<br>
Blunt the sharpness;   
Untangle the knots;   
Soften the glare;   
Let your wheels move only along old ruts.    
<br>
Darkly visible, it only seems as if it were there.   
I know not whose son it is.   
It images the forefather of God.

Heaven and earth are ruthless, and treat the myriad creatures as straw dogs;   
the sage is ruthless, and treats the people as straw dogs.    
<br>
Is not the space between heaven and earth like a bellows?   
It is empty without being exhausted:   
The more it works the more comes out.    
<br>
Much speech leads inevitably to silence.   
Better to hold fast to the void.

The spirit of the valley never dies.   
This is called the mysterious female.   
The gateway of the mysterious female   
Is called the root of heaven and earth.   
Dimly visible, it seems as if it were there,   
Yet use will never drain it.

Heaven and earth are enduring.   
The reason why heaven and earth can be enduring is that they do not give themselves life.   
Hence they are able to be long-lived.    
<br>
Therefore the sage puts his person last and it comes first,   
Treats it as extraneous to himself and it is preserved.    
<br>
Is it not because he is without thought of self that he is able to accomplish his private ends?

Highest good is like water.   
Because water excels in benefiting the myriad creatures without contending with them and settles where none would like to be, it comes close to the way.    
<br>
In a home it is the site that matters;   
In quality of mind it is depth that matters;   
In an ally it is benevolence that matters;   
In speech it is good faith that matters;   
In government it is order that matters;   
In affairs it is ability that matters;   
In action it is timeliness that matters.    
<br>
It is because it does not contend that it is never at fault.

Rather than fill it to the brim by keeping it upright   
Better to have stopped in time;   
Hammer it to a point   
And the sharpness cannot be preserved for ever;   
There may be gold and jade to fill a hall   
But there is none who can keep them.   
To be overbearing when one has wealth and position   
Is to bring calamity upon oneself.   
To retire when the task is accomplished   
Is the way of heaven.

When carrying on your head your perplexed bodily soul   
Can you embrace in your arms the One and not let go?   
In concentrating your breath can you become as supple   
As a babe?   
Can you polish your mysterious mirror   
And leave no blemish?   
Can you love the people and govern the state   
Without resorting to action?   
When the gates of heaven open and shut   
Are you capable of keeping to the role of the female?   
When your discernment penetrates the four quarters   
Are you capable of not knowing anything?    
<br>
It gives them life and rears them.    
<br>
It gives them life yet claims no possession;   
It benefits them yet exacts no gratitude;   
It is the steward yet exercises no authority.   
Such is called the mysterious virtue.

Thirty spokes share one hub.   
Adapt the nothing therein to the purpose in hand, and you will have the use of the cart.

Adapt the nothing therein to the purpose in hand, and you will have the use of the vessel.   
Cut out doors and windows in order to make a room.   
Adapt the nothing therein to the purpose in hand, and you will have the use of the room.    
<br>
Thus what we gain is Something, yet it is by virtue of Nothing that this can be put to use.

The five colors make man's eyes blind;   
The five notes make his ears deaf;   
The five tastes injure his palate;   
Riding and hunting   
Make his mind go wild with excitement;   
Goods hard to come by   
Serve to hinder his progress.    
<br>
Hence the sage is   
For the belly   
Not for the eye.    
<br>
Therefore he discards the one and takes the other.

Favor and disgrace are things that startle;   
High rank is, like one's body, a source of great trouble.    
<br>
What is meant by saying favor and disgrace are things that startle?   
Favor when it is bestowed on a subject serves to startle as much as when it is withdrawn.   
This is what is meant by saying that favor and disgrace are things that startle.   
What is meant by saying that high rank is, like one's body, a source of great trouble?   
The reason I have great trouble is that I have a body.   
When I no longer have a body, what trouble have I?    
<br>
Hence he who values his body more than dominion over the empire can be entrusted with the empire.   
He who loves his body more than dominion over the empire can be given the custody of the empire.

What cannot be seen is called evanescent;

These three cannot be fathomed

Its upper part is not dazzling;   
Its lower part is not obscure.   
Dimly visible, it cannot be named

This is called the shape that has no shape,   
The image that is without substance.   
This is called indistinct and shadowy.   
Go up to it and you will not see its head;   
Follow behind it and you will not see its rear.    
<br>
Hold fast to the way of antiquity   
In order to keep in control the realm of today.   
The ability to know the beginning of antiquity   
Is called the thread running through the way.

Of old he who was well versed in the way   
Was minutely subtle, mysteriously comprehending,   
And too profound to be known.   
It is because he could not be known   
That he can only be given a makeshift description:    
<br>
Tentative, as if fording a river in winter,   
Hesitant, as if in fear of his neighbors;   
Formal like a guest;   
Falling apart like the thawing ice;   
Thick like the uncarved block;   
Vacant like a valley;   
Murky like muddy water.    
<br>
Who can be muddy and yet, settling, slowly become limpid?   
Who can be at rest and yet, stirring, slowly come to life?   
He who holds fast to this way   
Desires not to be full.   
It is because he is not full   
That he can be worn and yet newly made.

I do my utmost to attain emptiness;   
I hold firmly to stillness.   
The myriad creatures all rise together   
And I watch their return.   
The teaming creatures   
All return to their separate roots.   
Returning to one's roots is known as stillness.   
This is what is meant by returning to one's destiny.   
Returning to one's destiny is known as the constant.   
Knowledge of the constant is known as discernment.    
<br>
Woe to him who wilfully innovates   
While ignorant of the constant,   
But should one act from knowledge of the constant   
One's action will lead to impartiality,   
Impartiality to kingliness,   
Kingliness to heaven,   
Heaven to the way,   
The way to perpetuity,   
And to the end of one's days one will meet with no danger.

And there will be no more thieves and bandits.    
<br>
These three, being false adornments, are not enough   
And the people must have something to which they can attach themselves:   
Exhibit the unadorned and embrace the uncarved block,   
Have little thought of self and as few desires as possible.

Between yea and nay   
How much difference is there?   
Between good and evil   
How great is the distance?    
<br>
What others fear   
One must also fear.    
<br>
The multitude are joyous   
As if partaking of the offering   
Or going up to a terrace in spring.   
I alone am inactive and reveal no signs,   
And wax without having reached the limit.   
Like a baby that has not yet learned to smile,   
Listless as though with no home to go back to.   
The multitude all have more than enough.   
I alone seem to be in want.   
My mind is that of a fool - how blank!   
Vulgar people are clear.   
I alone am drowsy.   
Vulgar people are alert.   
I alone am muddled.   
Calm like the sea;   
Like a high wind that never ceases.   
The multitude all have a purpose.   
I alone am foolish and uncouth.   
I alone am different from others   
And value being fed by the mother.

In his every movement a man of great virtue   
Follows the way and the way only.    
<br>
As a thing the way is   
Shadowy and indistinct.   
Indistinct and shadowy,   
Yet within it is an image;   
Shadowy and indistinct,   
Yet within it is a substance.   
Dim and dark,   
Yet within it is an essence.   
This essence is quite genuine   
And within it is something that can be tested.    
<br>
From the present back to antiquity,   
Its name never deserted it.   
It serves as a means for inspecting the fathers of the multitude.    
<br>
How do I know that the fathers of the multitude are like that?   
By means of this.

Bowed down then preserved;   
Bent then straight;   
Hollow then full;   
Worn then new;   
A little then benefited;   
A lot then perplexed.    
<br>
Therefore the sage embraces the One and is a model for the empire.    
<br>
He does not show himself, and so is conspicuous;   
He does not consider himself right, and so is illustrious;   
He does not brag, and so has merit;   
He does not boast, and so endures.    
<br>
It is because he does not contend that no one in the empire is in a position to contend with him.    
<br>
The way the ancients had it, 'Bowed down then preserved', is no empty saying.   
Truly it enables one to be preserved to the end.

To use words but rarely   
Is to be natural.    
<br>
Hence a gusty wind cannot last all morning, and a sudden downpour cannot last all day.   
Who is it that produces these? Heaven and earth.   
If even heaven and earth cannot go on forever, much less can man.   
That is why one follows the way.    
<br>
A man of the way conforms to the way;   
A man of virtue conforms to virtue;   
A man of loss conforms to loss.   
He who conforms to the way is gladly accepted by the way;   
He who conforms to virtue is gladly accepted by virtue;   
He who conforms to loss is gladly accepted by loss.    
<br>
When there is not enough faith, there is lack of good faith.

He who tiptoes cannot stand; he who strides cannot walk.    
<br>
He who shows himself is not conspicuous;   
He who considers himself right is not illustrious;   
He who brags will have no merit;   
He who boasts will not endure.    
<br>
From the point of view of the way these are 'excessive food and useless excresences'.   
As there are Things that detest them, he who has the way does not abide in them.

There is a thing confusedly formed,   
Born before heaven and earth.   
Silent and void   
It stands alone and does not change,   
Goes round and does not weary.   
It is capable of being the mother of the world.   
I know not its name   
So I style it 'the way'.    
<br>
I give it the makeshift name of 'the great'.   
Being great, it is further described as receding,   
Receding, it is described as far away,   
Being far away, it is described as turning back.    
<br>
Hence the way is great;   
Heaven is great;   
Earth is great;   
The king is also great.   
Within the realm there are four things that are great,   
And the king counts as one.    
<br>
Man models himself on earth,   
Earth on heaven,   
Heaven on the way,   
And the way on that which is naturally so.

The heavy is the root of the light;   
The still is the lord of the restless.    
<br>
Therefore the gentleman when travelling all day   
Never lets the heavily laden carts out of his sight.   
It is only when he is safely behind walls and watch-towers   
That he rests peacefully and is above worries.   
How, then, should a ruler of ten thousand chariots   
Make light of his own person in the eyes of the empire?    
<br>
If light, then the root is lost;   
If restless, then the lord is lost.

善行無轍迹  
善言無瑕讁  
善數不用籌策  
善閉無關楗而不可開  
善結無繩約而不可解

One who excels in travelling leaves no wheel tracks;   
One who excels in speech makes no slips;   
One who excels in reckoning uses no counting rods;   
One who excels in shutting uses no bolts yet what he has shut cannot be opened.   
One who excels in tying uses no cords yet what he has tied cannot be undone.    
<br>
Therefore the sage always excels in saving people, and so abandons no one;   
Always excels in saving things, and so abandons nothing.    
<br>
This is called following one's discernment.    
<br>
Hence the good man is the teacher the bad learns from;   
And the bad man is the material the good works on.   
Not to value the teacher   
Nor to love the material   
Though it seems clever, betrays great bewilderment.    
<br>
This is called the essential and the secret.

Know the male   
But keep to the role of the female   
And be a ravine to the empire.   
If you are a ravine to the empire,   
Then the constant virtue will not desert you   
And you will again return to being a babe.    
<br>
Know the white   
But keep to the role of the sullied   
And be a model to the empire.   
If you are a model to the empire,   
Then the constant virtue will not be wanting   
And you will return to the infinite,

Know honour   
But keep to the role of the disgraced   
And be a valley to the empire.   
If you are a valley to the empire,   
Then the constant virtue will be sufficient   
And you will return to being the uncarved block.    
<br>
When the uncarved block shatters it becomes vessels.   
The sage makes use of these and becomes the lord over the officials.    
<br>
Hence the greatest cutting does not sever.

Whoever takes the empire and wishes to do anything to it I see will have no respite.   
The empire is a sacred vessel and nothing should be done to it.   
Whoever does anything to it will ruin it;   
whoever lays hold of it will lose it.    
<br>
Hence some things lead and some follow;   
Some breathe gently and some breathe hard;   
Some are strong and some are weak;   
Some destroy and some are destroyed.    
<br>
Therefore the sage avoids excess, extravagance, and arrogance.

One who assists the ruler of men by means of the way does not intimidate the empire by a show of arms.    
<br>
This is something which is liable to rebound.   
Where troops have encamped   
There will brambles grow;   
In the wake of a mighty army   
Bad harvests follow without fail.    
<br>
One who is good aims only at bringing his campaign to a conclusion and dare not thereby intimidate.   
Bring it to a conclusion but do not brag;   
Bring it to a conclusion but do not be arrogant;   
Bring it to a conclusion but only when there is no choice;   
Bring it to a conclusion but do not intimidate.    
<br>
A creature in its prime doing harm to the old   
Is known as going against the way.   
That which goes against the way will come to an early end.

It is because arms are instruments of ill omen and there are Things that detest them that the one who has the way does not abide by their use.   
The gentleman gives precedence to the left when at home, but to the right when he goes to war.   
Arms are instruments of ill omen, not the instruments of the gentleman.   
When one is compelled to use them, it is best to do so without relish.   
There is no glory in victory, and so to glorify it despite this is to exult in the killing of men.   
One who exults in the killing of men will never have his way in the empire.   
On occasions of rejoicing precedence is given to the left;   
On occasions of mourning precedence is given to the right.   
A lieutenants place is on the left;   
The general's place is on the right.   
This means that it is mourning rites that are observed.   
When great numbers of people are killed, one should weep over them with sorrow.   
When victorious in war, one should observe the rites of mourning.

The way is for ever nameless.   
Though the uncarved block is small   
No one in the world dare claim its allegiance.   
Should lords and princes be able to hold fast to it   
The myriad creatures will submit of their own accord,   
Heaven and earth will unite and sweet dew will fall,   
And the people will be equitable, though no one so decrees.   
Only when it is cut are there names.   
As soon as there are names   
One ought to know that it is time to stop.   
Knowing when to stop one can be free from danger.    
<br>
The way is to the world as the River and the Sea are to rivulets and streams.

The way is broad, reaching left as well as right.   
The myriad creatures depend on it for life yet it claims no authority.   
It accomplishes its task yet lays claim to no merit.   
It clothes and feeds the myriad creatures yet lays no claim to being their master.    
<br>
For ever free of desire, it can be called small;   
Yet as it lays no claim to being master when the myriad creatures turn to it, it can be called great.    
<br>
It is because it never attempts itself to become great that it succeeds in becoming great.

Have in your hold the great image   
And the empire will come to you.   
Coming to you and meeting with no harm   
It will be safe and sound.   
Music and food   
Will induce the wayfarer to stop.    
<br>
The way in its passage through the mouth is without flavor.   
It cannot be seen,   
It cannot be heard,   
Yet it cannot be exhausted by use.

If you would have a thing shrink,   
You must first stretch it;   
If you would have a thing weakened,   
You must first strengthen it;   
If you would have a thing laid aside,   
You must first set it up;   
If you would take from a thing,   
You must first give to it.    
<br>
This is called subtle discernment:   
The submissive and weak will overcome the hard and strong.

The fish must not be allowed to leave the deep;   
The instruments of power in a state must not be revealed to anyone.

The way never acts, yet nothing is left undone.   
Should lords and princes be able to hold fast to it,   
The myriad creatures will be transformed of their own accord.   
After they are transformed, should desire raise its head,   
I shall press it down with the weight of the nameless uncarved block.   
The nameless uncarved block   
Is but freedom from desire,   
And if I cease to desire and remain still,   
The empire will be at peace of its own accord.

下德爲之而有以爲

A man of the highest virtue does not keep to virtue and that is why he has virtue.   
A man of the lowest virtue never strays from virtue and that is why he is without virtue.   
The former never acts yet leaves nothing undone.   
The latter acts but there are things left undone.   
A man of the highest benevolence acts, but from no ulterior motive.   
A man of the highest rectitude acts, but from ulterior motive.   
A man most conversant in the rites acts, but when no one responds rolls up his sleeves and resorts to persuasion by force.    
<br>
Hence when the way was lost there was virtue;   
When virtue was lost there was benevolence;   
When benevolence was lost there was rectitude;   
When rectitude was lost there were the rites.    
<br>
The rites are the wearing thin of loyalty and good faith   
And the beginning of disorder;   
Foreknowledge is the flowery embellishment of the way   
And the beginning of folly.    
<br>
Hence the man of large mind abides in the thick not in the thin, in the fruit not in the flower.    
<br>
Therefore he discards the one and takes the other.

Of old, these came to be in possession of the One:   
Heaven in virtue of the One is limpid;   
Earth in virtue of the One is settled;   
Gods in virtue of the One have their potencies;   
The valley in virtue of the One is full;   
The myriad creatures in virtue of the One are alive;   
Lords and princes in virtue of the One become leaders of the empire.   
It is the One that makes these what they are.    
<br>
Without what makes it limpid heaven might split;   
Without what makes it settled earth might sink;   
Without what gives them their potencies gods might spend themselves;   
Without what makes it full the valley might run dry;   
Without what keeps them alive the myriad creatures might perish;   
Without what makes them leaders lords and princes might fall.    
<br>
Hence the superior must have the inferior as root;   
The high must have the low as base.    
<br>
Thus lords and princes refer to themselves as 'solitary', 'desolate', and 'hapless'.   
This is taking the inferior as root, is it not?    
<br>
Hence the highest renown is without renown,   
Not wishing to be one among many like jade   
Nor to be aloof like stone.

When the best student hears about the way   
He practises it assiduously;   
When the average student hears about the way   
It seems to him there one moment and gone the next;   
When the worst student hears about the way   
He laughs out loud.   
If he did not laugh   
It would be unworthy of being the way.    
<br>
Hence the Chien yen has it:   
The way that is bright seems dull;   
The way that is forward seems to lead backward;   
The way that is even seems rough.   
The highest virtue is like the valley;   
The sheerest whiteness seems sullied;   
Ample virtue seems defective;   
Vigorous virtue seems indolent;   
Plain virtue seems soiled;   
The great square has no corners.   
The great vessel takes long to complete;   
The great note is rarefied in sound;   
The great image has no shape.    
<br>
The way conceals itself in being nameless.   
It is the way alone that excels in bestowing and in accomplishing.

The way begets one;   
One begets two;   
Two begets three;   
Three begets the myriad creatures.    
<br>
The myriad creatures carry on their backs the yin and embrace in their arms the yang and are the blending of the generative forces of the two.    
<br>
There are no words which men detest more than 'solitary', 'desolate', and 'hapless', yet lords and princes use these to refer to themselves.    
<br>
Thus a thing is sometimes added to by being diminished and diminished by being added to.    
<br>
What others teach I also teach.   
'The violent shall not come to a natural end.'   
I shall take this as my precept.

That is why I know the benefit of resorting to no action.   
The teaching that uses no words, the benefit of resorting to no action, these are beyond the understanding of all but a very few in the world.

When the way prevails in the empire, fleet-footed horses are relegated to ploughing in the fields;

There is no crime greater than having too many desires;   
There is no disaster greater than not being content;   
There is no misfortune greater than being covetous.

When going one way means life and going the other means death, three in ten will be comrades in life, three in ten will be comrades in death, and there are those who value life and as a result move into the realm of death, and these also number three in ten.   
Why is this so? Because they set too much store by life.   
I have heard it said that one who excels in safeguarding his own life does not meet with rhinoceros or tiger when travelling on land nor is he touched by weapons when charging into an army.   
There is nowhere for the rhinoceros to pitch its horn;   
There is nowhere for the tiger to place its claws;   
There is nowhere for the weapon to lodge its blade.   
Why is this so? Because for him there is no realm of death.

The way gives them life;   
Virtue rears them;   
Things give them shape;   
Circumstances bring them to maturity.    
<br>
Therefore the myriad creatures all revere the way and honor virtue.   
Yet the way is revered and virtue honored not because this is decreed by any authority but because it is natural for them to be treated so.    
<br>
Thus the way gives them life and rears them;   
Brings them up and nurses them;   
Brings them to fruition and maturity;   
Feeds and shelters them.    
<br>
It gives them life yet claims no possession;   
It benefits them yet exacts no gratitude;   
It is the steward yet exercises no authority.   
Such is called the mysterious virtue.

The world had a beginning   
And this beginning could be the mother of the world.   
When you know the mother   
Go on to know the child.   
After you have known the child   
Go back to holding fast to the mother,   
And to the end of your days you will not meet with danger.    
<br>
Block the openings,   
Shut the doors,   
And all your life you will not run dry.   
Unblock the openings,   
Add to your troubles,   
And to the end of your days you will be beyond salvation.    
<br>
To see the small is called discernment;   
To hold fast to the submissive is called strength.   
Use the light   
But give up the discernment.   
Bring not misfortune upon yourself.    
<br>
This is known as following the constant.

Were I possessed of the least knowledge, I would, when walking on the great way, fear only paths that lead astray.   
The great way is easy, yet people prefer by-paths.    
<br>
The court is corrupt,   
The fields are overgrown with weeds,   
The granaries are empty;   
Yet there are those dressed in fineries,   
With swords at their sides,   
Filled with food and drink,   
And possessed of too much wealth.   
This is known as taking the lead in robbery.    
<br>
Far indeed is this from the way.

What is firmly rooted cannot be pulled out;   
What is tightly held in the arms will not slip loose;   
Through this the offering of sacrifice by descendants will never come to an end.    
<br>
Cultivate it in your person   
And its virtue will be genuine;   
Cultivate it in the family   
And its virtue will be more than sufficient;   
Cultivate it in the hamlet   
And its virtue will endure;   
Cultivate it in the state   
And its virtue will abound;   
Cultivate it in the empire   
And its virtue will be pervasive.    
<br>
Hence look at the person through the person;   
Look at the family through the family;   
Look at the hamlet through the hamlet;   
Look at the state through the state;   
Look at the empire through the empire.    
<br>
How do I know that the empire is like that?   
By means of this.

One who possesses virtue in abundance is comparable to a new born babe:   
Poisonous insects will not sting it;   
Ferocious animals will not pounce on it;   
Predatory birds will not swoop down on it.   
Its bones are weak and its sinews supple yet its hold is firm.   
It does not know the union of male and female yet its male member will stir:   
This is because its virility is at its height.   
It howls all day yet does not become hoarse:   
This is because its harmony is at its height.   
To know harmony is called the constant;   
To know the constant is called discernment.   
To try to add to one's vitality is called ill-omened;   
For the mind to egg on the breath is called violent.    
<br>
A creature in its prime doing harm to the old   
Is known as going against the way.   
That which goes against the way will come to an early end.

This is known as mysterious sameness.    
<br>
Hence you cannot get close to it, nor can you keep it at arm's length;   
You cannot bestow benefit on it, nor can you do it harm;   
You cannot ennoble it, nor can you debase it.    
<br>
Therefore it is valued by the empire.

Govern the state by being straightforward;   
Wage war by being crafty;   
But win the empire by not being meddlesome.    
<br>
How do I know that it is like that?   
By means of this.    
<br>
The more taboos there are in the empire   
The poorer the people;   
The more sharpened tools the people have   
The more benighted the state;   
The more skills the people have   
The further novelties multiply;   
The better known the laws and edicts   
The more thieves and robbers there are.    
<br>
Hence the sage says,   
I take no action and the people are transformed of themselves;   
I prefer stillness and the people are rectified of themselves;   
I am not meddlesome and the people prosper of themselves;   
I am free from desire and the people of themselves become simple like the uncarved block.

When the government is muddled   
The people are simple;   
When the government is alert   
The people are cunning.    
<br>
It is on disaster that good fortune perches;   
It is beneath good fortune that disaster crouches.    
<br>
Who knows the limit? Does not the straightforward exist?   
The straighforward changes again into the crafty, and the good changes again into the monstrous.   
Indeed, it is long since the people were perplexed.    
<br>
Therefore the sage is square-edged but does not scrape,   
Has corners but does not jab,   
Extends himself but not at the expense of others,   
Shines but does not dazzle.

In ruling the people and in serving heaven it is best for a ruler to be sparing.   
It is because he is sparing   
That he may be said to follow the way from the start;   
Following the way from the start he may be said to accumulate an abundance of virtue;   
Accumulating an abundance of virtue there is nothing he cannot overcome;   
When there is nothing he cannot overcome, no one knows his limit;   
When no one knows his limit   
He can possess a state;   
When he possesses the mother of a state   
He can then endure.   
This is called the way of deep roots and firm stems by which one lives to see many days.

Governing a large state is like boiling a small fish.    
<br>
When the empire is ruled in accordance with the way,   
The spirits lose their potencies.   
Or rather, it is not that they lose their potencies,   
But that, though they have their potencies, they do not harm the people.   
It is not only they who, having their potencies, do not harm the people,   
The sage, also, does not harm the people.   
As neither does any harm, each attributes the merit to the other.

A large state is the lower reaches of a river:   
The place where all the streams of the world unite.    
<br>
In the union of the world,   
The female always gets the better of the male by stillness.    
<br>
Being still, she takes the lower position.    
<br>
Hence the large state, by taking the lower position, annexes the small state;   
The small state, by taking the lower position, affiliates itself to the large state.    
<br>
Thus the one, by taking the lower position, annexes;   
The other, by taking the lower position, is annexed.   
All that the large state wants is to take the other under its wing;   
All that the small state wants is to have its services accepted by the other.   
If each of the two wants to find its proper place,   
It is meet that the large should take the lower position.

The way is the refuge for the myriad creatures.   
It is that by which the good man protects,   
And that by which the bad is protected.    
<br>
Beautiful words when offered will win high rank in return;   
Beautiful deeds can raise a man above others.    
<br>
Even if a man is not good, why should he be abandoned?    
<br>
Hence when the emperor is set up and the three ducal ministers are appointed, he who makes a present of the way without stirring from his seat is preferable to one who offers presents of jade disks followed by a team of four horses.   
Why was this way valued of old?   
Was it not said that by means of it one got what one wanted and escaped the consequences when one transgressed?    
<br>
Therefore it is valued by the empire.

Do that which consists in taking no action;   
Pursue that which is not meddlesome;   
Savor that which has no flavor.    
<br>
Make the small big and the few many;   
Do good to him who has done you an injury.    
<br>
Lay plans for the accomplishment of the difficult before it becomes difficult;   
Make something big by starting with it when small.    
<br>
Difficult things in the word must needs have their beginnings in the easy;   
Big things must needs have their beginnings in the small.    
<br>
Therefore it is because the sage never attempts to be great that he succeeds in becoming great.    
<br>
One who makes promises rashly rarely keeps good faith;   
One who is in the habit of considering things easy meets with frequent difficulties.    
<br>
Therefore even the sage treats some things as difficult.   
That is why in the end no difficulties can get the better of him.

It is easy to maintain a situation while it is still secure;   
It is easy to deal with a situation before symptoms develop;   
It is easy to break a thing when it is yet brittle;   
It is easy to dissolve a thing when it is yet minute.    
<br>
Deal with a thing while it is still nothing;   
Keep a thing in order before disorder sets in.    
<br>
A tree that can fill the span of a man's arms   
Grows from a downy tip;   
A terrace nine storeys high   
Rises from hodfuls of earth;   
A journey of a thousand miles   
Starts from beneath one's feet.    
<br>
Whoever does anything to it will ruin it;   
Whoever lays hold of it will lose it.    
<br>
Therefore the sage, because he does nothing, never ruins anything;   
And, because he does not lay hold of anything, loses nothing.    
<br>
In their enterprises the people   
Always ruin them when on the verge of success.   
Be as careful at the end as at the beginning   
And there will be no ruined enterprises.    
<br>
Therefore the sage desires not to desire   
And does not value goods which are hard to come by;   
Learns to be without learning   
And makes good the mistakes of the multitude   
In order to help the myriad creatures to be natural and to refrain from daring to act.

Of old those who excelled in the pursuit of the way did not use it to enlighten the people but to hoodwink them.   
The reason why the people are difficult to govern is that they are too clever.    
<br>
Hence to rule a state by cleverness   
Will be to the detriment of the state;   
Not to rule a state by cleverness   
Will be a boon to the state.   
These two are models.   
Always to know the models   
Is known as mysterious virtue.   
Mysterious virtue is profound and far-reaching,   
But when things turn back it turns back with them.    
<br>
Only then is complete conformity realized.

是以天下樂推而不厭  
以其不爭  
故天下莫能與之爭

The reason why the River and the Sea are able to be king of the hundred valleys is that they excel in taking the lower position.   
Hence they are able to be king of the hundred valleys.    
<br>
Therefore, desiring to rule over the people,   
One must in one's words humble oneself before them;   
And, desiring to lead the people,   
One must, in one's person, follow behind them.    
<br>
Therefore the sage takes his place over the people yet is no burden;   
takes his place ahead of the people yet causes no obstruction.   
That is why the empire supports him joyfully and never tires of doing so.    
<br>
It is because he does not contend that no one in the empire is in a position to contend with him.

故似不肖

我有三寶

天將救之

The whole world says that my way is vast and resembles nothing.   
It is because it is vast that it resembles nothing.   
If it resembled anything, it would, long before now, have become small.    
<br>
I have three treasures   
Which I hold and cherish.   
The first is known as compassion,   
The second is known as frugality,   
The third is known as not daring to take the lead in the empire;   
Being compassionate one could afford to be courageous,   
Being frugal one could afford to extend one's territory,   
Not daring to take the lead in the empire one could afford to be lord over the vessels.    
<br>
Now, to forsake compassion for courage, to forsake frugality for expansion, to forsake the rear for the lead, is sure to end in death.    
<br>
Through compassion, one will triumph in attack and be impregnable in defence.   
What heaven succours it protects with the gift of compassion.

One who excels as a warrior does not appear formidable;   
One who excels in fighting is never roused in anger;   
One who excels in defeating his enemy does not join issue;   
One who excels in employing others humbles himself before them.    
<br>
This is known as the virtue of non-contention;   
This is known as making use of the efforts of others;   
This is known as matching the sublimity of heaven.

The strategists have a saying,   
I dare not play the host but play the guest,   
I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot instead.    
<br>
This is known as marching forward when there is no road,   
Rolling up one's sleeves when there is no arm,   
Dragging one's adversary by force when there is no adversary,   
And taking up arms when there are no arms.    
<br>
There is no disaster greater than taking on an enemy too easily.   
So doing nearly cost me my treasure.   
Thus of two sides raising arms against each other,   
It is the one that is sorrow-stricken that wins.

My words are very easy to understand and very easy to put into practice,   
Yet no one in the world can understand them or put them into practice.    
<br>
Words have an ancestor and affairs have a sovereign.    
<br>
It is because people are ignorant that they fail to understand me.   
Those who understand me are few;   
Those who harm me are honoured.    
<br>
Therefore the sage, while clad in homespun, conceals on his person a priceless piece of jade.

To know yet to think that one does not know is best;   
Not to know yet to think that one knows will lead to difficulty.    
<br>
It is by being alive to difficulty that one can avoid it.   
The sage meets with no difficulty.   
It is because he is alive to it that he meets with no difficulty.

When the people lack a proper sense of awe, then some awful visitation will descend upon them.    
<br>
Do not constrict their living space;   
Do not press down on their means of livelihood.   
It is because you do not press down on them that they will not weary of the burden.    
<br>
Hence the sage knows himself but does not display himself,   
Loves himself but does not exalt himself.    
<br>
Therefore he discards the one and takes the other.

He who is fearless in being bold will meet with his death;   
He who is fearless in being timid will stay alive.   
Of the two, one leads to good, the other to harm.    
<br>
Heaven hates what it hates,   
Who knows the reason why?    
<br>
Therefore even the sage treats some things as difficult.    
<br>
The way of heaven   
Excels in overcoming though it does not contend,   
In responding though it does not speak,   
In attracting though it does not summon,   
In laying plans though it appears slack.    
<br>
The net of heaven is cast wide.   
Though the mesh is not fine, yet nothing ever slips through.

When the people are not afraid of death, wherefore frighten them with death?   
Were the people always afraid of death, and were I able to arrest and put to death those who innovate, then who would dare?   
There is a regular executioner whose charge it is to kill.   
To kill on behalf of the executioner is what is described as chopping wood on behalf of the master carpenter.   
In chopping wood on behalf of the master carpenter, there are few who escape hurting their own hands instead.

The people are hungry:

That the people are hungry.   
The people are difficult to govern.   
It is because those in authority are too fond of action   
That the people are difficult to govern.   
The people treat death lightly:   
It is because the people set too much store by life   
That they treat death lightly.    
<br>
It is just because one has no use for life that one is wiser than the man who values life.

A man is supple and weak when living, but hard and stiff when dead.   
Grass and trees are pliant and fragile when living, but dried and shrivelled when dead.   
Thus the hard and the strong are the comrades of death;   
The supple and the weak are the comrades of life.    
<br>
Therefore a weapon that is strong will not vanquish;   
A tree that is strong will suffer the axe.   
The strong and big takes the lower position,   
The supple and weak takes the higher position.

Is not the way of heaven like the stretching of a bow?   
The high it presses down,   
The low it lifts up;   
The excessive it takes from,   
The deficient it gives to.    
<br>
It is the way of heaven to take from what has in excess in order to make good what is deficient.   
The way of man is otherwise: it takes from those who are in want in order to offer this to those who already have more than enough.   
Who is there that can take what he himself has in excess and offer this to the empire?   
Only he who has the way.    
<br>
Therefore the sage benefits them yet exacts no gratitude,   
Accomplishes his task yet lays claim to no merit.    
<br>
Is this not because he does not wish to be considered a better man than others?

In the world there is nothing more submissive and weak than water.   
Yet for attacking that which is hard and strong nothing can surpass it.   
This is because there is nothing that can take its place.    
<br>
That the weak overcomes the strong,   
And the submissive overcomes the hard,   
Everyone in the world knows yet no one can put this knowledge into practice.    
<br>
Therefore the sage says,   
One who takes on himself the humiliation of the state   
Is called a ruler worthy of offering sacrifices to the gods of earth and millet.   
One who takes on himself the calamity of the state   
Is called a king worthy of dominion over the entire empire.    
<br>
Straightforward words seem paradoxical.

When peace is made between great enemies,   
Some enmity is bound to remain undispelled.   
How can this be considered perfect?    
<br>
Therefore the sage takes the left-hand tally, but exacts no payment from the people.   
The man of virtue takes charge of the tally;   
The man of no virtue takes charge of exaction.    
<br>
It is the way of heaven to show no favoritism.   
It is for ever on the side of the good man.

Reduce the size of the population and the state.   
Ensure that even though the people have tools of war for a troop or a battalion they will not use them;   
And also that they will be reluctant to move to distant places because they look on death as no light matter.    
<br>
Even when they have ships and carts, they will have no use for them;   
And even when they have armor and weapons, they will have no occasion to make a show of them.    
<br>
Bring it about that the people will return to the use of the knotted rope,   
Will find relish in their food   
And beauty in their clothes,   
Will be content in their abode   
And happy in the way they live.    
<br>
Though adjoining states are within sight of one another,   
And the sound of dogs barking and cocks crowing in one state can be heard in another,   
yet the people of one state will grow old and die without having had any dealings with those of another.
