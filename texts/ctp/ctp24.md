## 王維 (early eighth century) 過香積寺

1 bù zhi xiang ji sì  
2 shù lii rù yún feng  
3 guu mù wú rén jìng  
4 shen shan hé chù zhong

1 不知香積寺  
2 數里入雲峰  
3 古木無人徑  
4 深山何處鐘

1 I had not realized that the Temple of Accumulated Fragrance  
2 Was several miles into the clouded peaks.  
3 A path through ancient trees where no one was;  
4 Somewhere deep in the mountains the sound of a bell.

5 quán sheng yè wei shí  
6 rì sè leeng qing song  
7 bó mù kong tán qu  
8 an chán zhì dú lóng

5 泉聲咽危石  
6 日色冷青松  
7 薄暮空潭曲  
8 安禪制毒龍

5 A brook's voice sobs between precipitous rocks;  
6 The sunlight is cold on the blue pines.  
7 Towards evening, in the bend of a silent pool,  
8 By calm meditation I tame my poisonous dragon.

## 常建 (early eighth century) 題破山寺後禪院

1 qing chén rù guu sì  
2 chu rì zhào gao lín  
3 zhú jìng tong you chù  
4 chán fáng hua mù shen

1 清晨入古寺  
2 初日照高林  
3 竹徑通幽處  
4 禪房花木深

1 Clear dawn enters (or: In the clear dawn I enter) the ancient temple  
2 The first sun shines on the high woods.  
3 A path through bamboos leads to a secluded place;  
4 Around the monks' quarters the blossoming trees are deep.

5 shan guang yuè niaao xìng  
6 tán yiing kong rén xin  
7 wàn lài cii ju jì  
8 wéi yú zhong qìng yin

5 山光悦鳥性  
6 潭影空人心  
7 萬籟此俱寂  
8 惟餘鐘磬音

5 The mountain light cheers the birds' natures;  
6 The pool's reflections still my mind.  
7 All Nature's sounds are silent here;  
8 All that remains is the sound of bell and chiming-bowl.
