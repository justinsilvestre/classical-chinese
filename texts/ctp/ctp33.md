## 賈島 (779-843) 題李凝幽居

xián ju shaao lín bìng
caao jìng rù huang yuán
niaao sù chí bian shù
seng qiao yuè xià mén

閒居少鄰並
草徑入荒園
鳥宿池邊樹
僧敲月下門

You live quietly with a few close neighbors;
A grass-grown path leads into your overgrown garden.
The birds had gone to roost in the trees by the pond
When this old monk knocked at your moonlit door.

guò qiáo fen yee sè
yí shí dòng yún gen
zàn qù huán lái cii
you qi bù fù yán

過橋分野色
移石動雲根
暫去還來此
幽期不負言

Crossing the bridge, I could distinguish the colors of the countryside.
The drifting rocks moved against the roots of the clouds.
I shall leave for now but I'll be back here again:
I shall not go back on my promise to see you in your retreat.

## 司空曙 (eighth century) 石井

tái sè biàn chun shí
tóng yin rù hán jiing
you rén dú jí shí
xian lè cán yáng yiing

苔色遍春石
桐陰入寒井
幽人獨汲時
先樂殘陽影

Moss-color covers all the spring-lit rocks;
Lute-tree shade enters the chilly well.
When the recluse comes alone to draw water
He first enjoys the sun's last rays.

## 盧綸 (late eighth century) 山中詠古木

gao mù yii xiao suoo
yè yuu fù qiu feng
zhuì yè míng cóng zhú
xié gen yong duàn péng

高木已蕭索
夜雨復秋風
墜葉鳴叢竹
斜根擁斷蓬

The tall tree is lonely and chill
[From] night rains and autumn winds.
His fallen leaves rustle in the clustered bamboos;
His slanting roots clutch wandering tumbleweed.

bàn qin shan sè lii
cháng zài shuii sheng zhong
cii dì hé rén dào
yún mén qù yì tong

半侵山色裏
長在水聲中
此地何人到
雲門去亦通

Half immersed in the mount's face;
Constantly amid the sound of waters.
Who ever comes to this place [to visit him]?
[Through] the cloud-gates you may also reach him.
