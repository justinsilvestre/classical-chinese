## 賈島 (779-843) 題李凝幽居

1 xián ju shaao lín bìng  
2 caao jìng rù huang yuán  
3 niaao sù chí bian shù  
4 seng qiao yuè xià mén

1 閒居少鄰並  
2 草徑入荒園  
3 鳥宿池邊樹  
4 僧敲月下門

1 You live quietly with a few close neighbors;  
2 A grass-grown path leads into your overgrown garden.  
3 The birds had gone to roost in the trees by the pond  
4 When this old monk knocked at your moonlit door.

5 guò qiáo fen yee sè  
6 yí shí dòng yún gen  
7 zàn qù huán lái cii  
8 you qi bù fù yán

5 過橋分野色  
6 移石動雲根  
7 暫去還來此  
8 幽期不負言

5 Crossing the bridge, I could distinguish the colors of the countryside.  
6 The drifting rocks moved against the roots of the clouds.  
7 I shall leave for now but I'll be back here again:  
8 I shall not go back on my promise to see you in your retreat.

## 司空曙 (eighth century) 石井

1 tái sè biàn chun shí  
2 tóng yin rù hán jiing  
3 you rén dú jí shí  
4 xian lè cán yáng yiing

1 苔色遍春石  
2 桐陰入寒井  
3 幽人獨汲時  
4 先樂殘陽影

1 Moss-color covers all the spring-lit rocks;  
2 Lute-tree shade enters the chilly well.  
3 When the recluse comes alone to draw water  
4 He first enjoys the sun's last rays.

## 盧綸 (late eighth century) 山中詠古木

1 gao mù yii xiao suoo  
2 yè yuu fù qiu feng  
3 zhuì yè míng cóng zhú  
4 xié gen yong duàn péng

1 高木已蕭索  
2 夜雨復秋風  
3 墜葉鳴叢竹  
4 斜根擁斷蓬

1 The tall tree is lonely and chill  
2 [From] night rains and autumn winds.  
3 His fallen leaves rustle in the clustered bamboos;  
4 His slanting roots clutch wandering tumbleweed.

5 bàn qin shan sè lii  
6 cháng zài shuii sheng zhong  
7 cii dì hé rén dào  
8 yún mén qù yì tong

5 半侵山色裏  
6 長在水聲中  
7 此地何人到  
8 雲門去亦通

5 Half immersed in the mount's face;  
6 Constantly amid the sound of waters.  
7 Who ever comes to this place [to visit him]?  
8 [Through] the cloud-gates you may also reach him.
