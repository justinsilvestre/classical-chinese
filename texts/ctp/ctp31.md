## 章碣 (late ninth century) 桃源

1 jué bì xiang qi shì dòng mén  
2 xi rén cóng cii rù xian yuán  
3 shù zhu hua xià féng zhu cuì  
4 bàn quu ge zhong laao zii sun

1 絶壁相攲是洞門  
2 昔人從此入仙源  
3 數株花下逢珠翠  
4 半曲歌中老子孫

1 Where sheer cliffs leaned towards one another was the gateway to the cave;  
2 From here a man in days gone by entered the immortals' source.  
3 Beneath the blossom of several trees he met [dancers wearing] pearls and kingfisher-feathers,  
4 Laozi's descendants halfway through a song, in the midst of singing.

5 bié hòu zì yí yuán lì mèng  
6 gui lái shuí xìn diào weng yán  
7 shan qián kong yoou wú qíng shuii  
8 yóu rào dang shí bì shù cun

5 別後自疑園吏夢  
6 歸來誰信釣翁言  
7 山前空有無情水  
8 猶遶當時碧樹村

5 After taking his leave he naturally supposed that it was a dream [like that] of the orchard-keeper;  
6 When he came home who (= nobody) believed the old angler's tale?  
7 In vain before the mountains the uncaring stream  
8 Still circles what once was an emerald-tree village.

## 常建 (early eighth century) 三日尋李九莊

1 yuu xie yáng lín dong dù tóu  
2 yoong hé san rì dàng qing zhou  
3 gù rén jia zài táo hua àn  
4 zhí dào mén qián xi shuii liú

1 雨歇楊林東渡頭  
2 永和三日蕩輕舟  
3 故人家在桃花岸  
4 直到門前溪水流

1 The rain has stopped at the ferry-landing east of the willow-grove;  
2 On Lanting anniversary I row in a light boat.  
3 My old friend's house is on a peach-blossom bank;  
4 Right up to his garden-gate the stream's water flows.

## 張旭 (seventh to eighth centuries) 桃花溪

1 yiin yiin fei qiáo gé yee yan  
2 shí ji xi pàn wèn yú chuán  
3 táo hua jìn rì suí liú shuii  
4 dòng zài qing xi hé chù bian

1 隱隱飛橋隔野煙  
2 石磯西畔問漁船  
3 桃花盡日隨流水  
4 洞在清溪何處邊

1 Faintly seen is the flying bridge through the wildland mists;  
2 On the west side of an overhanging crag I ask [an man in] a fishing-boat:  
3 'Peach-blossom comes down with the flowing water all day long;  
4 Whereabouts on this pure stream is the cave?'

## 李白 (701-762) 山中問答

1 wèn yú hé yì qi bì shan  
2 xiào ér bù dá xin zì xián  
3 táo hua liú shuii yaao rán qù  
4 bié yoou tian dì fei rén jian

1 問余何意棲碧山  
2 笑而不答心自閑  
3 桃花流水窅然去  
4 別有天地非人間

1 You ask me what is my purpose, lodging among green hills;  
2 I smile but do not answer, for my mind is at peace of itself.  
3 Peach-blossom on flowing water passes into secret depths:  
4 There is another earth and sky that is not in this world of ours.
