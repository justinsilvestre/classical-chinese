## 章碣 (late ninth century) 桃源

jué bì xiang qi shì dòng mén
xi rén cóng cii rù xian yuán
shù zhu hua xià féng zhu cuì
bàn quu ge zhong laao zii sun

絶壁相攲是洞門
昔人從此入仙源
數株花下逢珠翠
半曲歌中老子孫

Where sheer cliffs leaned towards one another was the gateway to the cave;
From here a man in days gone by entered the immortals' source.
Beneath the blossom of several trees he met [dancers wearing] pearls and kingfisher-feathers,
Laozi's descendants halfway through a song, in the midst of singing.

bié hòu zì yí yuán lì mèng
gui lái shuí xìn diào weng yán
shan qián kong yoou wú qíng shuii
yóu rào dang shí bì shù cun

別後自疑園吏夢
歸來誰信釣翁言
山前空有無情水
猶遶當時碧樹村

After taking his leave he naturally supposed that it was a dream [like that] of the orchard-keeper;
When he came home who (= nobody) believed the old angler's tale?
In vain before the mountains the uncaring stream
Still circles what once was an emerald-tree village.

## 常建 (early eighth century) 三日尋李九莊
yuu xie yáng lín dong dù tóu
yoong hé san rì dàng qing zhou
gù rén jia zài táo hua àn
zhí dào mén qián xi shuii liú

雨歇楊林東渡頭
永和三日蕩輕舟
故人家在桃花岸
直到門前溪水流

The rain has stopped at the ferry-landing east of the willow-grove;
On Lanting anniversary I row in a light boat.
My old friend's house is on a peach-blossom bank;
Right up to his garden-gate the stream's water flows.

## 張旭 (seventh to eighth centuries) 桃花溪
yiin yiin fei qiáo gé yee yan
shí ji xi pàn wèn yú chuán
táo hua jìn rì suí liú shuii
dòng zài qing xi hé chù bian


隱隱飛橋隔野煙
石磯西畔問漁船
桃花盡日隨流水
洞在清溪何處邊

Faintly seen is the flying bridge through the wildland mists;
On the west side of an overhanging crag I ask [an man in] a fishing-boat:
'Peach-blossom comes down with the flowing water all day long;
Whereabouts on this pure stream is the cave?'

## 李白 (701-762) 山中問答

wèn yú hé yì qi bì shan
xiào ér bù dá xin zì xián
táo hua liú shuii yaao rán qù
bié yoou tian dì fei rén jian

問余何意棲碧山
笑而不答心自閑
桃花流水窅然去
別有天地非人間

You ask me what is my purpose, lodging among green hills;
I smile but do not answer, for my mind is at peace of itself.
Peach-blossom on flowing water passes into secret depths:
There is another earth and sky that is not in this world of ours.
