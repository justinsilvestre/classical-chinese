## 無名士 (Han dynasty) 古詩三首，其三古

01 xin shù lán huì pa  
02 zá yòng dù héng caao  
03 zhong zhao caai qí hua  
04 rì mu bù yíng bào

01 新樹蘭蕙葩  
02 雜用杜蘅草  
03 終朝采其花  
04 日暮不盈抱

01 I've recently planted orchids;  
02 Among them I've used wild ginger.  
03 All day I've gather their flowers;  
04 By sunset my arms are not full.

05 caai zhi yù wèi shuí  
06 suoo si zài yuaan dào  
07 xin xiang yì xiao xie  
08 fán huá huì ku gaao

05 采之欲遺誰  
06 所思在遠道  
07 馨香易銷歇  
08 繁華會枯槁

05 Having gathered them, who am I going to give them to?  
06 My dear one is on a far road (= journey).  
07 Their fragrance will easily melt away and vanish;  
08 Their glory will soon wither.

09 chàng wàng hé suoo yán  
10 lín feng sòng huái bào

09 悵望何所言  
10 臨風送懷抱

09 How can I tell him my yearning?  
10 I'll send him a hug on the wind.

1 shè jiang caai fú róng  
2 lán zé duo fang caao  
3 caai zhi yù wèi shuí  
4 suoo si zài yuaan diào

1 涉江採芙蓉  
2 蘭澤多芳草  
3 采之欲遺誰  
4 所思在遠道

1 I waded the river gathering water-lilies;  
2 In the orchid marsh are many fragrant flowers.  
3 Having gathered them, who am I going to give them to?  
4 My dear one is on a far road (= journey).

5 huán gù wàng jiù xiang  
6 cháng lù màn hào hào  
7 tóng xin ér lí ju  
8 you shang yii zhong laao

5 還顧望舊鄉  
6 長路慢浩浩  
7 同心而離居  
8 憂傷以終老

5 When he looks back towards his home  
6 The long road stretches on forever.  
7 Our hearts are together but we are apart;  
8 I shall grieve till my life is ended.

## 無名士 (Han dynasty) 古詩十九首，其九

1 tíng zhong yoou qí shù  
2 lyù yè fa hua zi  
3 pán tiáo zhé qí róng  
4 jiang yii wèi suoo si

1 庭中有奇樹  
2 綠葉發華滋  
3 攀條折其榮  
4 將以遺所思

1 In the courtyard there is a lovely tree,  
2 Its green leaves sending forth a flood of blossom.  
3 I pull down a branch and break off a spray of bright blossom,  
4 Intending to give it to my dear one.

5 xin xiang yíng huái xiù  
6 lù yuaan mò zhì zhi  
7 cii wù hé zú gòng  
8 dàn gaan bié jing shí

5 馨香盈懷袖  
6 路遠莫致之  
7 此物何足貢  
8 但感別經時

5 Its fragrance fills my breast and sleeves,  
6 But I cannot get it to him, for the way is too far (= long).  
7 Such a thing is not really worth sending as a gift:  
8 It's just that I'm saddened that we've been parted for so long.
