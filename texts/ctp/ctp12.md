## 王之渙 (early 8th century) 登鸛雀樓
bái rì yi shan jìn  
huáng hé rù haai liú  
yù qióng qian lii mù  
gèng shàng yi céng lóu

白日依山盡  
黃河入海流  
欲窮千里目  
更上一層樓

The white sun reaches its end, resting on the mountains  
The Yellow River flows away into the sea.  
Wishing to go the limits of thousand-mile eyes,  
I climb a further storey of the tower.

## 柳宗元 (773-819) 江雪
qian shan niaao fei jué  
wàn jìng rén zong miè  
gu zhou suo lì weng  
dú diào hán jiang xuee

千山鳥飛絶  
萬徑人蹤滅  
孤舟簑笠翁  
獨釣寒江雪

On a thousand hills the birds have stopped flying;  
On a myriad paths people's tracks have been obliterated.  
A rain-caped, bamboo-hatted old man in a lonely boat  
Fishes alone amid the cold river's snows.
## 賈島 (early 9th century) 尋隱者不遇
song xià wèn tóng zii  
yán shi caai yào qù  
zhii zài cii shan zhong  
yún shen bù zhi chù

松下問童子  
言師采藥去  
只在此山中  
雲深不知處

Beneath the pine trees I inquired of your servant boy;  
He said his master had gone to gather herbs  
Somewhere among these mountains,  
But the clouds were deep and he knew not where.

## 陳子昂 (late seventh century) 登幽州台歌
qián bù jiàn guu rén  
hòu bù jiàn lái zhee  
niàn tian dì zhi you you  
dú chuàng rán ér tì xià

前不見古人  
後不見來者  
念天地之悠悠  
獨愴然而涕下

Before me I have not seen the people of ancient times;  
After me I shall not see those who will come.  
When I think of the vastness of heaven and earth  
I grieve alone and my tears fall.
