## 柳宗元 (773-819) 籠鷹詞

01 qi feng xi lì fei yán shuang  
02 cang ying shàng ji fan shù guang  
03 yún pi wù liè hóng ní duàn  
04 pi lì chè diàn shao píng gang

01 淒風淅瀝飛嚴霜  
02 蒼鷹上擊翻曙光  
03 雲披霧裂虹霓斷  
04 霹靂掣電捎平岡

01 When chill winds are shrill and there flies a severe frost,  
02 The goshawk (strikes =) rockets up and turns in the dawn light;  
03 The clouds are split, the mists are torn an the rainbow severed;  
04 [He drops like] a thunderclap and lightning-flash, and skims along the level hilltop.

05 huò rán jìng hé jiaan jing jí  
06 xià jué hú tù téng cang máng  
07 zhaao máo ween xuè baai niaao shì  
08 dú lì sì gù shí ji áng

05 砉然勁翮剪荆棘  
06 下攫狐兔騰蒼茫  
07 爪毛吻血百鳥逝  
08 獨立四顧時激昂

05 With a swish his energetic flight-feathers shear through the thorn-brakes;  
06 Downward he seizes a fox or hare, then mounts into the blue distance;  
07 With fur on his talons and blood on his beak [he frightens] all the birds away;  
08 He stands alone looking all round, and then he is fierce and proud.

09 yán feng rù shuu hu rán zhì  
10 yuu yì tuo luò zì cui cáng  
11 caao zhong lí shuu zú wéi huàn  
12 yi xi shí gù jing qiee shang

09 炎風溽暑忽然至  
10 羽翼脫落自摧藏  
11 草中狸鼠足爲患  
12 一夕十顧驚且傷

09 When scorching winds and humid summer heat suddenly arrive,  
10 His feathers moult and fall and he is downcast and hides away;  
11 Wildcat or rodent in the grass are enough to make him anxious;  
12 In a single night he looks round ten times, alarmed and distressed.

13 dàn yuàn qing shang fù wéi jià  
14 bá qù wàn lèi yún jian xiáng

13 但願清商復爲假  
14 拔去萬累雲間翔

13 He only wishes that clear[-skied] autumn would again make him free,  
14 To tear off his myriad restraints and soar among the clouds.

## 崔涂 (late ninth century) 孤雁

1 jii háng gui qù jìn  
2 pian yiing dú hé zhi  
3 mù yuu xiang hu shi  
4 hán táng dú xià chí

1 幾行歸去盡  
2 片影獨何之  
3 暮雨相呼失  
4 寒塘獨下遲

1 Several skeins have all gone home,  
2 But, isolated figure, where will *you* go?  
3 In the evening rain you call to them, lost;  
4 On a chilly pond you descend alone, belated.

5 zhuu yún di àn dù  
6 guan yuè leeng yáo suí  
7 wèi bì féng zeng zhuó  
8 gu fei zì kee yí

5 渚雲低暗渡  
6 關月冷遙隨  
7 未必逢矰繳  
8 孤飛自可疑

5 The islet clouds pass over low in the darkness;  
6 The Great Wall moon follows coldly in the distance.  
7 You will not necessarily meet the captive arrow,  
8 But, flying alone, you should be on your guard.

## 杜甫 (712-770) 鷗杜

1 jiang puu hán ou xì  
2 wú ta yì zì ráo  
3 què si fan yù yuu  
4 suí yì diaan qing miáo

1 江浦寒鷗戲  
2 無他亦自饒  
3 卻思翻玉羽  
4 隨意點青苗

1 Along the river's edge the cold gulls play,  
2 With no other [concerns] than doing as they please;  
3 Changing their minds, they turn their jade-white wings;  
4 Following their fancy, they dot the green rice-shoots.

5 xuee àn huán xu yù  
6 feng sheng yi rèn piao  
7 jii qún cang haai shàng  
8 qing yiing rì xiao xiao

5 雪暗還須浴  
6 風生一任飄  
7 幾群滄海上  
8 清影日蕭蕭

5 When snow is dark they still must bathe;  
6 When the wind rises, they drift, unresisting.  
7 A few flocks over the blue sea,  
8 Pure figures daily uttering desolate cries.
