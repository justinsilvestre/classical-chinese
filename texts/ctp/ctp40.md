## 柳宗元 (773-819) 籠鷹詞

qi feng xi lì fei yán shuang
cang ying shàng ji fan shù guang
yún pi wu liè hóng ní duàn
pi lì chì diàn shao píng gang
huò rán jìng hé jiaan jing jí
xià jué hù tù téng cang máng
zhaao máo ween xuè baai niaao shì
dú lì sì gù shí ji áng
yán feng rù shuu hu rán zhì
yuu yì tuo luò zì cui cáng
caao zhong lí shuu zú wéi huàn
yi xi shí gù jing qiee shang
dàn yuàn qing shang fù wéi jià
bá qù wàn lèi yún jian xiáng

淒風淅瀝飛嚴霜
蒼鷹上擊翻曙光
雲披霧裂虹霓斷
霹靂掣電捎平岡
砉然勁翮剪荆棘
下攫狐兔騰蒼茫
爪毛吻血百鳥逝
獨立四顧時激昂
炎風溽暑忽然至
羽翼脫落自摧藏
草中狸鼠足爲患
一夕十顧驚且傷
但願清商復爲假
拔去萬累雲間翔

When chill winds are shrill and there flies a severe frost,
The goshawk (strikes =) rockets up and turns in the dawn light;
The clouds are split, the mists are torn an the rainbow severed;
[He drops like] a thunderclap and lightning-flash, and skims along the level hilltop.
With a swish his energetic flight-feathers shear through the thorn-brakes;
Downward he seizes a fox or hare, then mounts into the blue distance;
With fur on his talons and blood on his beak [he frightens] all the birds away;
He stands alone looking all round, and then he is fierce and proud.
When scorching winds and humid summer heat suddenly arrive,
His feathers moult and fall and he is downcast and hides away;
Wildcat or rodent in the grass are enough to make him anxious;
In a single night he looks round ten times, alarmed and distressed.
He only wishes that clear[-skied] autumn would again make him free,
To tear off his myriad restraints and soar among the clouds.

## 崔涂 (late ninth century) 孤雁

jii háng gui qù jìn
pian yiing dú hé zhi
mù yuu xiang hu shi
hán táng dú xià chí
zhuu yún di àn dù
guan yuè leeng yáo suí
wèi bì féng zeng zhuó
gu fei zì kee yí

幾行歸去盡
片影獨何之
暮雨相呼失
寒塘獨下遲
渚雲低暗渡
關月冷遙隨
未必逢矰繳
孤飛自可疑

Several skeins have all gone home,
But, isolated figure, where will *you* go?
In the evening rain you call to them, lost;
On a chilly pond you descend alone, belated.
The islet clouds pass over low in the darkness;
The Great Wall moon follows coldly in the distance. You will not necessarily meet the captive arrow,
But, flying alone, you should be on your guard.

## 杜甫 (712-770) 鷗杜

jiang puu hán ou xì
wú ta yì zì ráo
què si fan yù yuu
suí yì diaan qing miáo
xuee àn huán xu yù
feng sheng yi rèn piao
jii qún cang haai shàng
qing yiing rì xiao xiao

江浦寒鷗戲
無他亦自饒
卻思翻玉羽
隨意點青苗
雪暗還須浴
風生一任飄
幾群滄海上
清影日蕭蕭

Along the river's edge the cold gulls play,
With no other [concerns] than doing as they please;
Changing their minds, they turn their jade-white wings;
Following their fancy, they dot the green rice-shoots.
When snow is dark they still must bathe;
When the wind rises, they drift, unresisting.
A few flocks over the blue sea,
Pure figures daily uttering desolate cries.
