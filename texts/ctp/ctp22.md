## 金昌緖 (Tang) 春怨

daa qii huáng niaao ér  
mò jiào zhi shàng tí  
tí shí jing qiè mèng  
bù dé dào liáo xi

打起黃鳥兒  
莫教枝上啼  
啼時驚妾夢  
不得到遼西

Drive away the orioles,  
Don't let them sing in the branches,  
For when they sing they disturb my dreams  
So that I cannot go to Liaoxi (where her husband is stationed).

## 李端 (late eighth century) 闉情

yuè luò xing xi tian yù míng  
gu deng wèi miè mèng nán chéng  
pi yi gèng xiàng mén qián wàng  
bù fèn zhao lái què xii sheng

月落星稀天欲明  
孤燈未滅夢難成  
披衣更向門前望  
不忿朝來鵲喜聲

The moon sets, the stars thin out, the sky begins to get light;  
My lonely lamp is not yet extinguished and dreams (= sleep and then dreams of her absent husband) will not come.  
I drape a coat round my shoulders and gaze further towards the front of the door (= out of the front door);  
I am not annoyed at the magpies' glad cries in the morning (as she would be if they had disturbed her from a dream about her husband).


## 溫庭筠 (early ninth century) 瑤瑟怨

bing diàn yín chuáng mèng bù chéng  
bì tian rú shuii yè yún qing  
yàn sheng yuaan guò xiao xiang qù  
shí èr lóu zhong yuè zì míng

冰簟銀床夢不成  
碧天如水夜雲輕  
雁聲遠過瀟湘去  
十二樓中月自明

On my icy mat on my silver[-ornamented] bed my dreams will not come;  
The blue sky is like water and the night-clouds float lightly.  
The cries of wild geese pass over bounds for Xiao and Xiang;  
In the Twelve Towers (= the boudoirs of the capital) the moon is bright by itself.

## 李商隱 (early ninth century) 嫦娥

yún muu píng feng zhú yiing shen  
cháng hé jiàn luò xiaao xing chén  
cháng é ying huii tou líng yào  
bì haai qing tian yè yè xin

雲母屏風燭影深  
長河漸落曉星沉  
嫦娥應悔偷靈藥  
碧海青天夜夜心

In the mica screen the candle's reflection is deep;  
The Milky Way gradually sets and the dawn stars drown.  
Chang'e must be regretting that she stole the magical elixir;  
Between blue sea and blue sky, her heart night by night.
