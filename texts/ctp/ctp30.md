## 帛道猷 (fifth century) 陵峰采藥觸興爲詩古

lián feng shù qian lii
xiu lín dài píng jin
yún guò yuaan shan yì
feng zhì geeng huang zhen

連峰數千里
修林帶平津
雲過遠山翳
風至梗荒榛

Linked peaks for several thousand miles;
Tall woods girdle steep-sided plateaus.
When clouds pass over, distant mountains are obscured;
When the wind arrives, it is blocked by tangled thickets.

máo cí yiin bù jiàn
ji míng zhi yoou rén
xián bù jiàn qí jìng
chù chù jiàn yí xin

茅茨隱不見
雞鳴知有人
閒步踐其徑
處處見遺薪

Thatched cottages are hidden from sight
But cocks crowing tell us there are people here.
I tread their paths with carefree steps;
Everywhere I see firewood they have left.

shii zhi baai dài xià
gù yoou shàng huáng mín

始知百代下
故有上皇民

Only now do I realize that after a hundred generations
The earliest rulers' subjects (= the Golden Age people) have been here all this time.

## 柳宗元 (773-819) 秋曉行南谷經荒村

miaao qiu shuang lù zhòng
chén qii xíng you guu
huáng yè fù xi qiáo
huang cun wéi guu mù

杪秋霜露重
晨起行幽谷
黃葉覆溪橋
荒村唯古木

Late autumn's frost and dew lie heavy
As I rise in the morning to walk the secluded valley.
Yellow leaves cover the bridge over the stream;
In the abandoned village there are only ancient trees.

hán hua shu jì lì
you quán wei duàn xù
ji xin jiuu yii wàng
hé shì jing mí lù

寒花疏寂歷
幽泉微斷續
機心久已忘
何事驚麋鹿

Cold flowers are spare and forlorn;
A hidden spring is faint and hesitant.
My worldly cunning is long forgotten,
So why should [my coming] startle the deer?
