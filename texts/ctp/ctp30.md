## 帛道猷 (fifth century) 陵峰采藥觸興爲詩古

01 lián feng shù qian lii  
02 xiu lín dài píng jin  
03 yún guò yuaan shan yì  
04 feng zhì geeng huang zhen

01 連峰數千里  
02 修林帶平津  
03 雲過遠山翳  
04 風至梗荒榛

01 Linked peaks for several thousand miles;  
02 Tall woods girdle steep-sided plateaus.  
03 When clouds pass over, distant mountains are obscured;  
04 When the wind arrives, it is blocked by tangled thickets.

05 máo cí yiin bù jiàn  
06 ji míng zhi yoou rén  
07 xián bù jiàn qí jìng  
08 chù chù jiàn yí xin

05 茅茨隱不見  
06 雞鳴知有人  
07 閒步踐其徑  
08 處處見遺薪

05 Thatched cottages are hidden from sight  
06 But cocks crowing tell us there are people here.  
07 I tread their paths with carefree steps;  
08 Everywhere I see firewood they have left.

09 shii zhi baai dài xià  
10 gù yoou shàng huáng mín

09 始知百代下  
10 故有上皇民

09 Only now do I realize that after a hundred generations  
10 The earliest rulers' subjects (= the Golden Age people) have been here all this time.

## 柳宗元 (773-819) 秋曉行南谷經荒村

1 miaao qiu shuang lù zhòng  
2 chén qii xíng you guu  
3 huáng yè fù xi qiáo  
4 huang cun wéi guu mù

1 杪秋霜露重  
2 晨起行幽谷  
3 黃葉覆溪橋  
4 荒村唯古木

1 Late autumn's frost and dew lie heavy  
2 As I rise in the morning to walk the secluded valley.  
3 Yellow leaves cover the bridge over the stream;  
4 In the abandoned village there are only ancient trees.

5 hán hua shu jì lì  
6 you quán wei duàn xù  
7 ji xin jiuu yii wàng  
8 hé shì jing mí lù

5 寒花疏寂歷  
6 幽泉微斷續  
7 機心久已忘  
8 何事驚麋鹿

5 Cold flowers are spare and forlorn;  
6 A hidden spring is faint and hesitant.  
7 My worldly cunning is long forgotten,  
8 So why should [my coming] startle the deer?
