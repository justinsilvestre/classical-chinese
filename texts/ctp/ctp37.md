## 劉万平 (early eighth century) 春怨

sha chuang rì luò jiàn huáng hun
jin wu wú rén jiàn lèi hén
jì mò kong tíng chun yù waan
lí hua maan dì bù kai mén

紗窗日落漸黃昏
金屋無人見淚痕
寂寞空庭春欲晚
梨花滿地不開門

[Seen through] her gauze window the sun sinks and gradually dusk [comes];
In her golden room (cf. gilded cage) there is no one to see the traces of her tears.
Lonely is the empty courtyard as the spring is about to be late (= is nearing its end);
Pear-blossom (fills =) covers the ground but she does not open her door.

## 李商隱 (early ninth century) 落花

gao gé kè jìng qù
xiaao yuán hua luàn fei
cen ci lián qu mò
tiáo dì sòng xié hui
cháng duàn wèi reen saao
yaan chuan réng yù gui
fang xin xiàng chun jìn
suoo dé shì zhan yi

高閣客竟去
小園花亂飛
參差連曲陌
迢遞送斜暉
腸斷未忍掃
眼穿仍欲歸
芳心向春盡
所得是霑衣

[Seen] from my high balcony the traveller has finally gone;
In the little garden the blossom flies in confusion,
Unevenly [heaping] onto the winding paths,
Distantly escorting the slanting sunlight (= the setting sun).
Heartbroken, I cannot bear to sweet it away;
I strain my eyes, still wanting him to return.
My blossoming heart is gone (towards =) with the spring,
And all I get is a tear-soaked dress.

## 白居易 (772-846) 賦得古原草送別

lí lí yuán shàng caao
yi suì yi ku róng
yee huoo shao bù jìn
chun feng chui yòu sheng
yuaan fang qin guu dào
qíng cuì jie huang chéng
yòu òng wáng sun qù
qi qi maan bié qíng

離離原上草
一歲一枯榮
野火燒不盡
春風吹又生
遠芳侵古道
晴翠接荒城
又送王孫去
萋萋滿別情

Luxuriant are the grasses on the plain,
Withering and flourishing once every year.
The wildfire cannot burn them out;
The spring breeze blows them into life again.
Their far-reaching fragrance invades the ancient road;
Their sunlit green reaches right up to the ruined city walls.
As I once more see my prince off
Their lushness is filled with the pangs of parting.

## 謝朓 (464-499) 王孫游

lyù caao màn rú si
zá shù hóng ying fa
wú lùn jun bù gui
jun gui fang yii xie

綠草漫如絲
雜樹紅英發
無論君不歸
君歸芳已歇

The green grasses spread like silk threads;
On the various trees pink blossoms burst forth.
Even if you do come home,
When you come the fragrant flowers will be over.

## 王融 (467-493) 王孫游

zhì jiuu deng guaang diàn
kai jin wàng suoo si
chun caao xíng yii xie
hé shì jiuu jia qi

置酒登廣殿
開襟望所思
春草行已歇
何事久佳期

I set out the wine when I go up onto [the balcony of] the spacious palace;
I open the front of my gown and yearn for my dear one.
The spring flowers will soon be over;
Why does he keep me waiting so long for reunion?

## 崔國輔 (eighth century) 王孫游

zì yuu wáng sun bié
pín kan huáng niaao fei
ying yóu chun hua wù
zhù chuu bù chéng gui

Since I said goodbye to my prince
I have frequently watched the orioles flying.
He must have become entranced by the spring flowers
And be stuck somewhere, unable to complete his journey home.

## 劉長卿 (eighth century) 經漂母墓

xi xián huái yi fàn
zi shì yii qian qiu
guu mù qiáo rén shì
qián cháo chuu shuii liú
zhuu pín xíng kè jiàn
shan mù dù jian chóu
chun caao máng máng lyù
wáng sun jiù cii yóu

昔賢懹ー飯
茲事已千秋
古墓樵人識
前朝楚水流
渚蘋行客薦
山木杜鵑愁
春草茫茫綠
王孫舊此遊

That worthy of long ago never forgot those meals,
But those events are now a thousand autumns past.
Her ancient tomb is known to the wood-cutters,
While the river of the former state of Chu flows on.
The islet's water-weeds are a couch for the exile;
In the mountain trees a cuckoo mourns.
Spring grasses stretch far, misty-green,
Here where the prince once wandered.
