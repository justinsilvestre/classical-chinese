## 劉万平 (early eighth century) 春怨

1 sha chuang rì luò jiàn huáng hun  
2 jin wu wú rén jiàn lèi hén  
3 jì mò kong tíng chun yù waan  
4 lí hua maan dì bù kai mén

1 紗窗日落漸黃昏  
2 金屋無人見淚痕  
3 寂寞空庭春欲晚  
4 梨花滿地不開門

1 [Seen through] her gauze window the sun sinks and gradually dusk [comes];  
2 In her golden room (cf. gilded cage) there is no one to see the traces of her tears.  
3 Lonely is the empty courtyard as the spring is about to be late (= is nearing its end);  
4 Pear-blossom (fills =) covers the ground but she does not open her door.

## 李商隱 (early ninth century) 落花

1 gao gé kè jìng qù  
2 xiaao yuán hua luàn fei  
3 cen ci lián qu mò  
4 tiáo dì sòng xié hui

1 高閣客竟去  
2 小園花亂飛  
3 參差連曲陌  
4 迢遞送斜暉

1 [Seen] from my high balcony the traveller has finally gone;  
2 In the little garden the blossom flies in confusion,  
3 Unevenly [heaping] onto the winding paths,  
4 Distantly escorting the slanting sunlight (= the setting sun).

5 cháng duàn wèi reen saao  
6 yaan chuan réng yù gui

8 suoo dé shì zhan yi

5 腸斷未忍掃  
6 眼穿仍欲歸  
7 芳心向春盡  
8 所得是霑衣

5 Heartbroken, I cannot bear to sweet it away;  
6 I strain my eyes, still wanting him to return.  
7 My blossoming heart is gone (towards =) with the spring,  
8 And all I get is a tear-soaked dress.

## 白居易 (772-846) 賦得古原草送別

1 lí lí yuán shàng caao  
2 yi suì yi ku róng  
3 yee huoo shao bù jìn  
4 chun feng chui yòu sheng

1 離離原上草  
2 一歲一枯榮  
3 野火燒不盡  
4 春風吹又生

1 Luxuriant are the grasses on the plain,  
2 Withering and flourishing once every year.  
3 The wildfire cannot burn them out;  
4 The spring breeze blows them into life again.

5 yuaan fang qin guu dào  
6 qíng cuì jie huang chéng  
7 yòu sòng wáng sun qù  
8 qi qi maan bié qíng

5 遠芳侵古道  
6 晴翠接荒城  
7 又送王孫去  
8 萋萋滿別情

5 Their far-reaching fragrance invades the ancient road;  
6 Their sunlit green reaches right up to the ruined city walls.  
7 As I once more see my prince off  
8 Their lushness is filled with the pangs of parting.

## 謝朓 (464-499) 王孫游

1 lyù caao màn rú si  
2 zá shù hóng ying fa  
3 wú lùn jun bù gui  
4 jun gui fang yii xie

1 綠草漫如絲  
2 雜樹紅英發  
3 無論君不歸  
4 君歸芳已歇

1 The green grasses spread like silk threads;  
2 On the various trees pink blossoms burst forth.  
3 Even if you do come home,  
4 When you come the fragrant flowers will be over.

## 王融 (467-493) 王孫游

1 zhì jiuu deng guaang diàn  
2 kai jin wàng suoo si  
3 chun caao xíng yii xie  
4 hé shì jiuu jia qi

1 置酒登廣殿  
2 開襟望所思  
3 春草行已歇  
4 何事久佳期

1 I set out the wine when I go up onto [the balcony of] the spacious palace;  
2 I open the front of my gown and yearn for my dear one.  
3 The spring flowers will soon be over;  
4 Why does he keep me waiting so long for reunion?

## 崔國輔 (eighth century) 王孫游

1 zì yuu wáng sun bié  
2 pín kan huáng niaao fei  
3 ying yóu chun caao wù  
4 zhù chuu bù chéng gui

1 自與王孫別  
2 頻看黃鳥飛  
3 應由春草誤  
4 著處不成歸

1 Since I said goodbye to my prince  
2 I have frequently watched the orioles flying.  
3 He must have become entranced by the spring flowers  
4 And be stuck somewhere, unable to complete his journey home.

## 劉長卿 (eighth century) 經漂母墓

1 xi xián huái yi fàn  
2 zi shì yii qian qiu

4 qián cháo chuu shuii liú

1 昔賢懷一飯  
2 茲事已千秋  
3 古墓樵人識  
4 前朝楚水流

1 That worthy of long ago never forgot those meals,  
2 But those events are now a thousand autumns past.  
3 Her ancient tomb is known to the wood-cutters,  
4 While the river of the former state of Chu flows on.

5 zhuu pín xíng kè jiàn  
6 shan mù dù juan chóu  
7 chun caao máng máng lyù  
8 wáng sun jiù cii yóu

5 渚蘋行客薦  
6 山木杜鵑愁  
7 春草茫茫綠  
8 王孫舊此遊

5 The islet's water-weeds are a couch for the exile;  
6 In the mountain trees a cuckoo mourns.  
7 Spring grasses stretch far, misty-green,  
8 Here where the prince once wandered.
