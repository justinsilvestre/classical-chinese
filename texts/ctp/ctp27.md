## 盧綸 (late eighth century) 題興善寺後池

1 gé chuang qi bái hè  
2 sì yuu jìng hú lín  
3 yuè zhào hé nián shù  
4 hua féng jii biàn rén

1 隔窗棲白鶴  
2 似與鏡湖鄰  
3 月照何年樹  
4 花逢幾遍人

1 Outside the window the white crains go to roost;  
2 It is as if I am neighbor to Mirror Lake.  
3 How old are the trees that the moon shines on?  
4 How many times has their blossom greeted visitors?

5 àn suo qing yoou lù  
6 tái jìng lyù wú chén  
7 yoong yuàn róng yi zhii  
8 seng zhong laao cii shen

5 岸莎青有路  
6 苔徑綠無塵  
7 永願容依止  
8 僧中老此身

5 There is a way through the green sedge on the bank;  
6 The mossy paths are green with no trace of dust.  
7 I've long wished I might be allowed to find refuge here  
8 And let this body age among the monks.

## 盧綸 (late eighth century) 宿石甕寺

2 qian lín wàn hè jì wú sheng  
3 yan níng ji shuii lóng shé zhé  
4 lù shi kong shan xing hàn míng

1 殿有寒燈草有螢  
2 千林萬壑寂無聲  
3 煙凝積水龍蛇蟄  
4 露濕空山星漢明

1 A cold lamp burns in the worship-hall, and fireflies in the grass;  
2 A thousand forests and a myriad valleys are still and silent.  
3 Mist thickens over the rain-pools where dragons and snakes lie hidden;  
4 Dew moistens the empty hills and the Milky Way is bright.

7 huí zhan xiang hào yin chuí lèi  
8 kuu haai bo táo hé rì píng

5 昏靄霧中悲世界  
6 曙霞光裏見王城  
7 回瞻相好因垂淚  
8 苦海波濤何日平

5 In the haze and mists of twilight I am sad for the world;  
6 In the light of colored clouds at down I see the royal city.  
7 I look back and gaze [at the temple], admire it, then weep:  
8 When will the waves in the see of suffering be stilled?
