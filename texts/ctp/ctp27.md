## 盧綸 (late eighth century) 題興善寺後池

1 gé chuang qi bái hè  
2 sì yuu jìng hú lín  
3 yuè zhào hé nián shù  
4 hua féng jii biàn rén

1 隔窗棲白鶴  
2 似與鏡湖鄰  
3 月照何年樹  
4 花逢幾遍人

1 Outside the window the white cranes go to roost;  
2 It seems like Mirror Lake and I are neighbors.  
3 How many years old are the trees that the moon shines on?  
4 How many times have their flowers greeted visitors?

5 àn suo qing yoou lù  
6 tái jìng lyù wú chén  
7 yoong yuàn róng yi zhii  
8 seng zhong laao cii shen

5 岸莎青有路  
6 苔徑綠無塵  
7 永願容依止  
8 僧中老此身

5 On the bank where the sedge is verdant there is a path;  
6 The mossy paths are green and free of dust.  
7 Ever have I wished they'd let me stay and settle
8 to let this body age among the monks.

## 盧綸 (late eighth century) 宿石甕寺

1 diàn yoou hán deng caao yoou yíng  
2 qian lín wàn hè jì wú sheng  
3 yan níng ji shuii lóng shé zhé  
4 lù shi kong shan xing hàn míng

1 殿有寒燈草有螢  
2 千林萬壑寂無聲  
3 煙凝積水龍蛇蟄  
4 露濕空山星漢明

1 In the worship-hall is a cold lamp, in the grass are fireflies.  
2 A thousand forests and a myriad valleys are still and without sound.  
3 Mist thickens over the pools of water where dragons and snakes lie hidden;  
4 Dew moistens the empty hills and the Milky Way is bright.

5 hun aai wù zhong bei shì jiè  
6 shù xiá guang lii jiàn wáng chéng  
7 huí zhan xiang hào yin chuí lèi  
8 kuu haai bo táo hé rì píng

5 昏靄霧中悲世界  
6 曙霞光裏見王城  
7 回瞻相好因垂淚  
8 苦海波濤何日平

5 In twilight's misty fog, I lament the world;  
6 In daybreak's hazy light, I see the royal city.  
7 I look back to admire it, then weep:  
8 The waves in the sea of suffering--on what day will they be stilled?
