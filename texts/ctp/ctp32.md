## 柳宗元 (773-819) 漁翁

yú weng yè bàng xi yán sù
xiaao jí qing xiang rán chuu zhú
yan xiao rì chu bù jiàn rén
aai naai yi sheng shan shuii lyù

漁翁夜傍西巖宿
曉汲清湘燃楚竹
煙銷日出不見人
欸乃一聲山水綠

The old fisherman has spent the night under the western cliff;
At dawn he draws clear Xiang [water] and makes a fire of Chu bamboo.
The mists disperse as the sun rises, and there is no one in sight;
With a single creak of his oar the mountains and river are green.

huí kan tian jì xià zhong liú
yán shàng wú xin yún xiang zhú

迴看天際下中流
巖上無心雲相逐

He turns to look at the edge of the sky as he goes down midstream;
Above the cliffs, mindlessly, the clouds follow upon each other.

## 綦毋潛 (early eighth century) 春泛若耶溪
you yì wú duàn jué
cii qù suí suoo oou
waan feng chui xíng zhou
hua lù rù xi koou

幽意無斷絕
此去隨所偶
晚風吹行舟
花路入溪口

This atmosphere of peaceful seclusion continues uninterrupted;
On this trip I'll go along with whatever I meet by change.
The evening breeze wafts my boat onwards
[Through] a path of [floating] blossom into the mouth of the stream.

jì yè zhuaan xi hè
gé shan wàng nán doou
tán yan fei róng róng
lín yuè di xiàng hòu

際夜轉西壑
隔山望南斗
潭煙飛溶溶
林月低向後

At the edge of the night I turn into West Creek;
I gaze at the Southern Dipper beyond the hills.
The mist on the pools floats, swirling and merging;
The woodland moon sinks low behind me.

sheng shì qiee mí màn
yuàn wéi chí gan soou

生事且瀰漫
願爲持竿叟

Life's business is in fact hazy and unpredictable;
I wish I could be an old man holding a fishing-rod.
