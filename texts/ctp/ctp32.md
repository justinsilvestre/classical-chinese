## 柳宗元 (773-819) 漁翁

1 yú weng yè bàng xi yán sù  
2 xiaao jí qing xiang rán chuu zhú  
3 yan xiao rì chu bù jiàn rén  
4 aai naai yi sheng shan shuii lyù

1 漁翁夜傍西巖宿  
2 曉汲清湘燃楚竹  
3 煙銷日出不見人  
4 欸乃一聲山水綠

1 The old fisherman has spent the night under the western cliff;  
2 At dawn he draws clear Xiang [water] and makes a fire of Chu bamboo.  
3 The mists disperse as the sun rises, and there is no one in sight;  
4 With a single creak of his oar the mountains and river are green.

5 huí kan tian jì xià zhong liú  
6 yán shàng wú xin yún xiang zhú

5 迴看天際下中流  
6 巖上無心雲相逐

5 He turns to look at the edge of the sky as he goes down midstream;  
6 Above the cliffs, mindlessly, the clouds follow upon each other.

## 綦毋潛 (early eighth century) 春泛若耶溪

01 you yì wú duàn jué  
02 cii qù suí suoo oou  
03 waan feng chui xíng zhou  
04 hua lù rù xi koou

01 幽意無斷絕  
02 此去隨所偶  
03 晚風吹行舟  
04 花路入溪口

01 This atmosphere of peaceful seclusion continues uninterrupted;  
02 On this trip I'll go along with whatever I meet by change.  
03 The evening breeze wafts my boat onwards  
04 [Through] a path of [floating] blossom into the mouth of the stream.

05 jì yè zhuaan xi hè  
06 gé shan wàng nán doou  
07 tán yan fei róng róng  
08 lín yuè di xiàng hòu

05 際夜轉西壑  
06 隔山望南斗  
07 潭煙飛溶溶  
08 林月低向後

05 At the edge of the night I turn into West Creek;  
06 I gaze at the Southern Dipper beyond the hills.  
07 The mist on the pools floats, swirling and merging;  
08 The woodland moon sinks low behind me.

09 sheng shì qiee mí màn  
10 yuàn wéi chí gan soou

09 生事且瀰漫  
10 願爲持竿叟

09 Life's business is in fact hazy and unpredictable;  
10 I wish I could be an old man holding a fishing-rod.
