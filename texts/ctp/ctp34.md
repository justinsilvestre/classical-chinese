## 韋應物 (late eighth century) 寄全椒山中道士唐

1 jin zhao jùn zhai leeng  
2 hu niàn shan zhong kè  
3 jiàn dii shù jing xin  
4 gui lái zhuu bái shí

1 今朝郡齋冷  
2 忽念山中客  
3 澗底束荆薪  
4 歸來煮白石

1 It was cold this morning in my study in the prefecture office  
2 And suddenly I thought of you, hermit of the hills,  
3 Bundling up thorn-sticks for fuel at the bottom of a ravine  
4 Then coming home to cook your white stones.

5 yù chí yi piáo jiuu  
6 yuaan wèi feng yuu xi  
7 luò yè maan kong shan  
8 hé chù xún xíng ji

5 欲持一瓢酒  
6 遠慰風雨夕  
7 落葉滿空山  
8 何處尋行跡

5 I was going to bring you a stoup of wine  
6 To cheer you up in this wild, wet evening,  
7 But fallen leaves cover the empty hills,  
8 So where could I seek your footprints?

## 劉長卿 (eighth century) 尋南溪常山道人隱居

1 yi lù jing xíng chù  
2 méi tái jiàn lyuu hén  
3 bái yún yi jìng zhuu  
4 chun caao bì xián mén

1 一路經行處  
2 莓苔見履痕  
3 白雲依靜渚  
4 春草閉閑門

1 All the way, wherever I pass through,  
2 I see your footprints in the moss.  
3 White clouds rest on the tranquil islets;  
4 Spring flowers block your unvisited gate.

5 guò yuu kan song sè  
6 suí shan dào shuii yuán  
7 xi hua yuu chán yì  
8 xiang duì yì wáng yán

5 過雨看松色  
6 隨山到水源  
7 溪花與禪意  
8 相對亦忘言

5 After the rain I look at the color of the pine-trees;  
6 I follow the hill to the source of the stream.  
7 Brookside flowers and your meditating mind  
8 Will look at one another, all words forgotten.

## 溫庭筠 (early ninth century) 處士盧岵山居

1 xi xi wèn qiáo kè  
2 yáo shì zhuu rén jia  
3 guu shù laao lián shí  
4 jí quán qing lòu sha

1 西溪問樵客  
2 遙識主人家  
3 古樹老連石  
4 急泉清露沙

1 At West Brook I asked [my way of] a woodcutter,  
2 Then in the distance I recognized my host's home.  
3 Ancient trees ha embraced the rocks with their adancing years;  
4 A rapid burn revealed the [bottom] sand by its clarity.

5 qian feng suí yuu àn  
6 yi jing rù yún xié  
7 rì mù fei ya jí  
8 maan shan qiáo mài hua

5 千峰隨雨暗  
6 一徑入雲斜  
7 日暮飛鴉集  
8 滿山蕎麥花

5 A thousand peaks darkened as they followed [the course of] the rain;  
6 The single path sloped up into the clouds.  
7 As the sun set the flying rooks assembled  
8 And the hillside was filled with [the whiteness of] buckwheat flowers.
