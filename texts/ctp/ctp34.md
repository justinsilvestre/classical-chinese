## 韋應物 (late eighth century) 寄全椒山中道士唐

jin zhao jùn zhai leeng
hu niàn shan zhong kè
jiàn dii shù jing xin
gui lái zhuu bái shí

今朝郡齋冷
忽念山中客
澗底束荆薪
歸來煮白石

It was cold this morning in my study in the prefecture office
And suddenly I thought of you, hermit of the hills,
Bundling up thorn-sticks for fuel at the bottom of a ravine
Then coming home to cook your white stones.

yù chí yi piáo jiuu
yuaan wèi feng yuu xi
luò yè maan kong shan
hé chù xún xíng ji

欲持一瓢酒
遠慰風雨夕
落葉滿空山
何處尋行跡

I was going to bring you a stoup of wine
To cheer you up in this wild, wet evening,
But fallen leaves cover the empty hills,
So where could I seek your footprints?

## 劉長卿 (eighth century) 尋南溪常山道人隱居

yi lù jing xíng chù
méi tái jiàn lyuu hén
bái yún yi jìng zhuu
chun caao bì xián mén

一路經行處
莓苔見履痕
白雲依靜渚
春草閉閑門

All the way, wherever I pass through,
I see your footprints in the moss.
White clouds rest on the tranquil islets;
Spring flowers block your unvisited gate.

guò yuu kan song sè
suí shan dào shuii yuán
xi hua yuu chán yì
xiang duì yì wáng yán

過雨看松色
隨山到水源
溪花與禪意
相對亦忘言

After the rain I look at the color of the pine-trees;
I follow the hill to the source of the stream.
Brookside flowers and your meditating mind
Will look at one another, all words forgotten.

## 溫庭筠 (early ninth century) 處士盧岵山居

xi xi wèn qiáo kè
yáo shì zhuu rén jia
guu shù laao lián shí
jí quán qing lòu sha

西溪問樵客
遙識主人家
古樹老連石
急泉清露沙

At West Brook I asked [my way of] a woodcutter,
Then in the distance I recognized my host's home.
Ancient trees ha embraced the rocks with their adancing years;
A rapid burn revealed the [bottom] sand by its clarity.

qian feng suí yuu àn
yi jing rù yún xié
rì mù fei ya jí
maan shan qiáo mài hua

千峰隨雨暗
一徑入雲斜
日暮飛鴉集
滿山蕎麥花

A thousand peaks darkened as they followed [the course of] the rain;
The single path sloped up into the clouds.
As the sun set the flying rooks assembled
And the hillside was filled with [the whiteness of] buckwheat flowers.
