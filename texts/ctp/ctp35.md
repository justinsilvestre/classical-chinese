## 邱爲 (eighth century) 尋西山隱者不遇

01 jué diing yi máo cí  
02 zhí shàng san shí lii  
03 kòu guan wú tóng pú  
04 kui shì wéi àn jii

01 絶頂一茅茨  
02 直上三十里  
03 叩關無童僕  
04 窺室惟案几

01 At the very top, a thatched cottage;  
02 All the way up, thirty li (= ten miles).  
03 I knock on the door, no servant-boy [answers];  
04 I peep inside: only the furniture.

05 ruò fei jin chái che  
06 ying shì diào qiu shuii  
07 cha chí bù xiang jiàn  
08 miin miaan kong yaang zhii

05 若非巾柴車  
06 應是釣秋水  
07 差池不相見  
08 黽勉空仰止

05 If he is not [out in] his covered cart  
06 He must be fishing in autumn floodwater.  
07 By miscalculation we did not meet;  
08 I tried my best, but my [attempt at a] visit has been in vain.

09 caao sè xin yuu zhong  
10 song sheng waan chuang lii  
11 jí zi qì you jué  
12 zì zú dàng xin eer

09 草色新雨中  
10 松聲晚窗裏  
11 及茲契幽絶  
12 自足蕩心耳

09 The color of grass (and flowers) in the new rain;  
10 The sound of pine-trees through evening windows.  
11 Coming here, I feel in tune with this superbly peaceful spot;  
12 [These things] alone are enough to cleanse my mind's hearing.

13 sui wú bin zhuu yì  
14 po dé qing jìng lii  
15 xìng jìn fang xià shan  
16 hé bì dài zhi zii

13 雖無賓主意  
14 頗得清淨理  
15 興盡方下山  
16 何必待之子

13 Even though we have not had the mood (= enjoyment) of guest and host,  
14 I've learned quite a lot about inner peace.  
15 My mood's fulfilled, only now do I descend the hill:  
16 There's no need now to wait for him.
