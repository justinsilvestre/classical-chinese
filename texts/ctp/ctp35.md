## 邱爲 (eighth century) 尋西山隱者不遇

jué diing yi máo cí
zhí shàng san shí lii
kòu guan wú tóng pú
kui shì wéi àn jii

絶頂一茅茨
直上三十里
叩關無童僕
窺室惟案几

At the very top, a thatched cottage;
All the way up, thirty li (= ten miles).
I knock on the door, no servant-boy [answers];
I peep inside: only the furniture.

ruò fei jin chái che
ying shì diào qiu shuii
cha chí bù xiang jiàn
miin miaan kong yaang zhii

若非巾柴車
應是釣秋水
差池不相見
黽勉空仰止

If he is not [out in] his covered cart
He must be fishing in autumn floodwater.
By miscalculation we did not meet;
I tried my best, but my [attempt at a] visit has been in vain.

caao sè xin yuu zhong
song sheng waan chuang lii
jí zi qì you jué
zì zú dàng xin eer

草色新雨中
松聲晚窗裏
及茲契幽絶
自足蕩心耳

The color of grass (and flowers) in the new rain;
The sound of pine-trees through evening windows.
Coming here, I feel in tune with this superbly peaceful spot;
[These things] alone are enough to cleanse my mind's hearing.

sui wú bin zhuu yì
po dé qing jìng lii
xìng jìn fang xià shan
hé bì dài zhi zii

雖無賓主意
頗得清淨理
興盡方下山
何必待之子

Even though we have not had the mood (= enjoyment) of guest and host,
I've learned quite a lot about inner peace.
My mood's fulfilled, only now do I descend the hill:
There's no need now to wait for him.
