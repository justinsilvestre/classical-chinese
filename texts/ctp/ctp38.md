## 李甲 (Sung dynasty) 憶王孫

qi qi fang caao yì wáng sun
liuu wài lóu gao kong duan hún
dù yuu sheng sheng bù reen wén
yù huáng hun
yuu daa lí hua shen bì mén

萋萋芳草憶王孫
柳外樓高空斷魂
杜宇聲聲不忍聞
欲黃昏
雨打梨花深閉門

Luxuriant the fragrant grasses, reminding me of my prince;
Tall is the tower beyond the willows where I break my heart in vain;
I cannot bear to hear the cuckoo calling, note after note.
When it is almost dusk
The rain beats the pear-blossom and my door is shut [enclosing me] deeply.

## 嚴仁 (Sung dynasty) 木蘭花

chun feng zhii zài yuán xi pàn
jì cài hua fán hú dié luàn
bing chí qíng lyù zhào huán kong
xiang jìng luò hóng chui yii duàn
yì cháng fan hèn yóu si duaan
jìn rì xiang si luò dài huaan
baao lián rù yuè bù qi rén
míng rì gui lái jun shì kàn

春風只在園西畔
薺菜花繁胡蝶亂
冰池晴綠照還空
香徑落紅吹已斷
意長翻恨游絲短
盡日相思羅帶緩
寶奩如月不欺人
明日歸來君試看

The spring breeze is only on the west side of the garden;
The shepherd's purse flowers bloom profusely and butterflies flutter hither and yon.
The sunlit green of the icy pond, though shone upon, is still empty;
The fallen pink blossom on the fragrant path has all been blown away.
My thoughts of you run on and on, but I'm grieved that my floating tresses are getting short;
All day long I miss you and my silk belt grows slack (from losing weight through anxiety).
My precious mirror is like the moon and does not lie to me;
If you come home tomorrow you can see for yourself.

## 歐陽修 (1007-1072) 踏莎行

hòu guaan méi cán
xi qiáo liuu xì
caao xun feng nuaan yáon zheng pèi
lí chóu jiàn yuaan jiàn wú qióng
tiáo tiáo bù duàn rú chun shuii
cùn cùn róu cháng

lóu gao mò jìn wei lán yii
píng wú jìn chù shì chun shan
xín rén gèng zài chun shan wài

候館梅殘
溪橋柳細
草薰風暖搖征轡
離愁漸遠漸無窮
迢迢不斷如春水
寸寸柔腸
盈盈粉淚
樓高莫近危闌倚
平蕪盡處是春山

At the prospect-tower the prunus-blossom was almost over;
At the bridge over the stream the willows were slender;
The flower-scented breeze was warm, swinging his departing bridle.
The sadness of parting became endless the farther he moved away
Into an unending distance like springtime floodwaters.
Every inch of my tender heart [aches],
My tears brim over on to my powdered [cheeks];
High in the tower I cannot lean [any longer] on this precipitous balcony-rail.
Where the open plain comes to an end are springtime hills;
The traveller is even beyond those springtime hills.
