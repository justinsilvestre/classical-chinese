## 李甲 (Sung dynasty) 憶王孫

1 qi qi fang caao yì wáng sun  
2 liuu wài lóu gao kong duàn hún

1 萋萋芳草憶王孫  
2 柳外樓高空斷魂

1 Luxuriant the fragrant grasses, reminding me of my prince;  
2 Tall is the tower beyond the willows where I break my heart in vain;

3 dù yuu sheng sheng bù reen wén  
4 yù huáng hun  
5 yuu daa lí hua shen bì mén  

3 杜宇聲聲不忍聞  
4 欲黃昏  
5 雨打梨花深閉門

3 I cannot bear to hear the cuckoo calling, note after note.  
4 When it is almost dusk  
5 The rain beats the pear-blossom and my door is shut [enclosing me] deeply.

## 嚴仁 (Sung dynasty) 木蘭花

1 chun feng zhii zài yuán xi pàn  
2 jì cài hua fán hú dié luàn  
3 bing chí qíng lyù zhào huán kong  
4 xiang jìng luò hóng chui yii duàn

1 春風只在園西畔  
2 薺菜花繁胡蝶亂  
3 冰池晴綠照還空  
4 香徑落紅吹已斷

1 The spring breeze is only on the west side of the garden;  
2 The shepherd's purse flowers bloom profusely and butterflies flutter hither and yon.  
3 The sunlit green of the icy pond, though shone upon, is still empty;  
4 The fallen pink blossom on the fragrant path has all been blown away.

5 yì cháng fan hèn yóu si duaan  
6 jìn rì xiang si luó dài huaan  
7 baao lián rú yuè bù qi rén  
8 míng rì gui lái jun shì kàn

5 意長翻恨游絲短  
6 盡日相思羅帶緩  
7 寶奩如月不欺人  
8 明日歸來君試看

5 My thoughts of you run on and on, but I'm grieved that my floating tresses are getting short;  
6 All day long I miss you and my silk belt grows slack (from losing weight through anxiety).  
7 My precious mirror is like the moon and does not lie to me;  
8 If you come home tomorrow you can see for yourself.

## 歐陽修 (1007-1072) 踏莎行

01 hòu guaan méi cán  
02 xi qiáo liuu xì  
03 caao xun feng nuaan yáo zheng pèi  
04 lí chóu jiàn yuaan jiàn wú qióng  
05 tiáo tiáo bù duàn rú chun shuii

01 候館梅殘  
02 溪橋柳細  
03 草薰風暖搖征轡  
04 離愁漸遠漸無窮  
05 迢迢不斷如春水  

01 At the prospect-tower the prunus-blossom was almost over;  
02 At the bridge over the stream the willows were slender;  
03 The flower-scented breeze was warm, swinging his departing bridle.  
04 The sadness of parting became endless the farther he moved away  
05 Into an unending distance like springtime floodwaters.

06 cùn cùn róu cháng  
07 yíng yíng feen lèi  
08 lóu gao mò jìn wei lán yii  
09 píng wú jìn chù shì chun shan  
10 xíng rén gèng zài chun shan wài

06 寸寸柔腸  
07 盈盈粉淚  
08 樓高莫近危闌倚  
09 平蕪盡處是春山  
10 行人更在春山外

06 Every inch of my tender heart [aches],  
07 My tears brim over on to my powdered [cheeks];  
08 High in the tower I cannot lean [any longer] on this precipitous balcony-rail.  
09 Where the open plain comes to an end are springtime hills;  
10 The traveller is even beyond those springtime hills.
