## 陶淵明 (365 - 427) 歸田園居五首 其一

01 shào wú shì sú yùn  
02 xìng been ài qiu shan  
03 wù luò chén waang zhong  
04 yi qù shí san nián

01 少無適俗韻  
02 性本愛丘山  
03 誤落塵網中  
04 一去十三年

01 When young I had no taste for fitting in with the conventional world;  
02 My nature had always been to love the hills.  
03 By mistake I fell into the worldly trap  
04 And once I was there I stayed for thirteen years.

05 ji niaao liàn jiù lín  
06 chí yú si gù yuan  
07 kai huang nán yee jì  
08 shoou zhuo gui yuán tián

05 羈鳥戀舊林  
06 池魚思故淵  
07 開荒南野際  
08 守拙歸園田

05 The caged bird longs for its old home-woods;  
06 The fish in the pond yearns for its old home-pool in the river.  
07 So I reclaimed some waste land in the countryside to the south [of the city]  
08 And preserved my simplicity by returning to garden and field.

09 fang zhái shí yú muu  
10 caao wu ba jiuu jian  
11 yú liuu yin hòu yán  
12 táo lii luó táng qián

09 方宅十餘畝  
10 草屋八九間  
11 榆柳蔭後簷  
12 桃李羅堂前

09 A square smallholding of a dozen mu (= a couple of acres),  
10 A thatched cottage of eight or nine jian.  
11 Elm and willow shade the eaves at the back,  
12 Peach and plum spread their branches in the front courtyard.

13 ài ài yuaan rén cun  
14 yi yi xu lii yan  
15 goou fèi shen xiàng zhong  
16 ji míng sang shù dian

13 曖曖遠人村  
14 依依墟里煙  
15 狗吠深巷中  
16 雞鳴桑樹巔

13 Dimly seen are the distant villages of people,  
14 Lazily rising is the smoke from the market-village.  
15 A dog barks in a deep lane,  
16 A cock crows from the top of a mulberry-tree.

17 hù tíng wú chén zá  
18 xu shì yoou yú xián  
19 jiuu zài fán lóng lii  
20 fù dé faan zì rán

17 戶庭無塵雜  
18 虛室有餘閑  
19 久在樊籠裏  
20 復得返自然

17 No dust or din indoors or out,  
18 Just plenty of peace in the empty rooms.  
19 I have been so long in the cage;  
20 Once more I have the opportunity to return to naturalness (= to be myself once more).


## 陶淵明 (365 - 427) 飲酒 其五

01 jié lú zài rén jìng  
02 ér wú che maa xuan  
03 wèn jun hé néng eer  
04 xin yuaan dì zì pian

01 結廬在人境  
02 而無車馬喧  
03 問君何能爾  
04 心遠地自偏

01 I built a hut in an inhabited area  
02 But without the din of carriages and horses.  
03 You ask: 'How did you manage that?'  
04 If the mind is distant the place becomes secluded by itself.

05 caai jú dong lí xià  
06 you rán jiàn nán shan  
07 shan qì rì xi jia  
08 fei niaao xiang yuu huán

05 採菊東籬下  
06 悠然見南山  
07 山氣日夕佳  
08 飛鳥相與還

05 I gather chrysanthemums under the eastern fence;  
06 Far off in the distance I see the Southern Hills.  
07 At sunset the mountain mists are beautiful  
08 And flying birds accompany one another home.

09 cii zhong yoou zhen yì  
10 yù biàn yii wàng yán

09 此中有真意  
10 欲辯已忘言

09 There is a true consciousness (= sense of reality) in this;  
10 If I try to explain it, all words are forgotten.
