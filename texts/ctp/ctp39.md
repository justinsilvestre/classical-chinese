01 gu hóng haai shàng lái  
02 chí huáng bù gaan gù  
03 cè jiàn shuang cuì niaao  
04 cháo zài san zhu shù

01 孤鴻海上來  
02 池潢不敢顧  
03 側見雙翠鳥  
04 巢在三珠樹

01 A solitary wild goose comes over the sea,  
02 Not daring to look round at the ponds.  
03 Sideways he sees a pair of kingfishers  
04 Nesting on a three-pearl tree.

05 jiaao jiaao zhen mù dian  
06 dé wú jin wán jù  
07 meei fú huàn rén zhii  
08 gao míng bi shén wù

05 矯矯珍木顚  
06 得無金丸懼  
07 美服患人指  
08 高明逼神惡

05 High up on the top of their treasure-tree  
06 Can they be free of the fear of the crossbow-pellet?  
07 Fine clothes [make the wearer] worry about being pointed at;  
08 Being exalted crowds the gods into hating one.

09 jin woo yóu míng míng  
10 yì zhee hé suoo mù

09 今我游冥冥  
10 弋者何所慕

09 But now that I wander too far to be seen  
10 What will the wildfowler set his heart upon?

## 張九齡 (678-740) 感遇其二

1 lán yè chun wei ruí  
2 guì hua qiu jiaao jié  
3 xin xin cii sheng yì  
4 zì eer wéi jia jié

1 蘭葉春威甤  
2 桂花秋皎潔  
3 欣欣此生意  
4 自爾爲佳節

1 In springtime the orchid leaves are luxuriant;  
2 In autumn the cassia flowers are purest white.  
3 So vigorous is this energy for growth  
4 Than alone and unaided they create the fair seasons.

5 shuí zhi lín qi zhee  
6 wén feng zuò xiang yuè  
7 caao mù yoou been xin  
8 hé qiú meei rén zhé

5 誰知林棲者  
6 聞風坐相悅  
7 草木有本心  
8 何求美人折

5 Little do they expect that the forest-dwellers (= recluses),  
6 sensing [their fragrance on] the breeze, will [come and] sit to enjoy them.  
7 Plants and trees have their own private purposes;  
8 They have no desire for a beautiful woman to pluck them.

## 張九齡 (678-740) 感遇其四

01 jiang nán yoou dan jú  
02 jing dong yóu lyù lín  
03 qii yi dì qì nuaan  
04 zì yoou suì hán xin

01 江南有丹橘  
02 經冬猶綠林  
03 豈伊地氣暖  
04 自有歲寒心

01 South of the Yangtse there grows the red orange;  
02 Through the winter its groves remain green.  
03 This is not because the climate is warm,  
04 But because it has its own determination [to survive] the year's cold.

05 kee yii jiàn jia kè  
06 nài hé zuu chóng shen  
07 yùn mìng wéi suoo yù  
08 xún huán bù kee xún

05 可以薦嘉客  
06 奈何阻重深  
07 運命惟所遇  
08 循環不可尋

05 It would make an ideal gift for an honored guest, but alas, [the place where it grows] is obstructed by many-layered [mountains] and  
06 deep [rivers].  
07 Fate is limited to what each of us encounters;  
08 Its cyclicality is beyond discovery.

09 tú yán shù táo lii  
10 cii mù qii wú yin

09 徒言樹桃李  
10 此木豈無陰

09 People only speak of planting peaches and plums,  
10 But this tree (= the orange) can provide shade just as well as these!
