## 張九齡 (678-740) 感遇其一

gu hong haai shàng lái
chí huáng bù gaan gù
cè jiàn shuang cuì niaao
cháo zài san zhu shù
jiaao jiaao zhen mù dian
dé wú jin wán jù
meei fú huàn rén zhii
gao míng bi shén wù
jin woo yóu míng míng
yù zhee hé suoo mù

孤鴻海上來
池潢不敢顧
側見雙翠鳥
巢在三珠樹
矯矯珍木顚
得無金丸懼
美服患人指
高明逼神惡
今我游冥冥
弋者何所慕

A solitary wild goose comes over the sea,
Not daring to look round at the ponds.
Sideways he sees a pair of kingfishers
Nesting on a three-pearl tree.
High up on the top of their treasure-tree
Can they be free of the fear of the crossbow-pellet?
Fine clothes [make the wearer] worry about being pointed at;
Being exalted crowds the gods into hating one.
But now that I wander too far to be seen
What will the wildfowler set his heart upon?

## 張九齡 (678-740) 感遇其二

lán yè chun wei ruí
guì hua qiu jiaao jié

zì eer wéi jia jié

蘭葉春威甤
桂花秋皎潔
欣欣此生意
自爾爲佳節
誰知林棲者
聞風坐相悅
草木有本心
何求美人折

In springtime the orchid leaves are luxuriant;
In autumn the cassia flowers are purest white.
So vigorous is this energy for growth
Than alone and unaided they create the fair seasons.
Little do they expect that the forest-dwellers (= recluses),
sensing [their fragrance on] the breeze, will [come and] sit to enjoy them.
Plants and trees have their own private purposes;
They have no desire for a beautiful woman to pluck them.

江南有丹橘
經冬猶綠林
豈伊地氣暖
自有歲寒心
可以薦嘉客
奈何阻重深
運命惟所遇
循環不可尋
徒言樹桃李
此木豈無陰

South of the Yangtse there grows the red orange;
Through the winter its groves remain green.
This is not because the climate is warm,
But because it has its own determination [to survive] the year's cold.
It would make an ideal gift for an honored guest, but alas, [the place where it grows] is obstructed by many-layered [mountains] and
deep [rivers].
Fate is limited to what each of us encounters;
Its cyclicality is beyond discovery.
People only speak of planting peaches and plums,
But this tree (= the orange) can provide shade just as well as these!
