## 李白 (701-762) 自遣
duì jiuu bù jué mìng  
luò hua yíng woo yi  
zuì qii bù xi yuè  
niaao huán rén yì xi

對酒不覺暝  
落花盈我衣  
醉起步溪月  
鳥還人亦稀

Sitting opposite a jug of wine I do not realize that it has got dark  
And that fallen blossom covers my gown.  
Drunk, I get up and walk in the moonlight by the stream,  
Where the birds have gone to roost and few people remain.

## 李白 (701-762) 静夜思
chuáng qián míng yuè guang  
yí shì dì shàng shuang  
juu tóu wàng míng yuè  
di tóu si gù xiang

床前明月光  
疑是地上霜  
舉頭望明月  
低頭思故鄉

Before my bed, the light of the bright moon;  
I thought it was frost on the ground.  
Raising my head, I gaze at the bright moon;  
Lowering my head, I long for my old home.

## 劉長卿 (eighth century) - 送靈澈
cang cang zhú lín sì  
yaao yaao zhong sheng waan  
hè lì dài xié yáng  
qing shan dú gui yuaan

蒼蒼竹林寺  
杳杳鐘聲晚  
荷笠帶斜陽  
青山獨歸遠

Misty grey is Bamboo Mountain Temple;  
Faint in the distance, the sound of the bell comes through the dusk.  
With your bamboo hat on your back and the light of the setting sun upon it,  
Up the green mountain you return alone to your distant home.

## 李白 (701-762) 贈內
san baai liù shí rì  
rì rì zuì rú ní  
sui wéi lii bái fù  
hé yì tài cháng qi

三百六十日  
日日醉如泥  
雖為李白婦  
何異太常妻

Three hundred and sixty days,  
every day I'm drunk as mud.  
Although you are Li Bai's woman,  
How are you different from the archbishop's wife?

## 張融 (seventh to eighth centuries) 別詩
bái yún shan shàng jìn  
qing feng song xià xie  
yù shì lí rén bei  
gu tái jiàn míng yuè

白雲山上盡  
清風松下歇  
欲識離人悲  
孤臺見明月

The white clouds are gone from the hills;  
The pure breeze pauses beneath the pines.  
If you wish to taste the grief of parting,  
See the bright moon from a lonely tower.

## 李白 (701-762) 聽蜀僧濬彈琴
shuu seng bào lyù qii  
xi xià é méi feng  
wèi woo yi hui shoou  
rú ting wàn hè song

蜀僧抱綠綺  
西下峨眉峰  
為我一揮手  
如聽萬壑松

A Sichuan monk, cradling a Green Silk lute,  
Westward descends Mt. Emei's peak.  
A single brush of his hand for me  
Is like listening to pines in a myriad valleys.

kè xin xii liú shuii  
yú xiaang rù shuang zhong  
bù jué bì shan mù  
qiu yún àn jii chóng

客心洗流水  
餘響入霜鐘  
不覺碧山暮  
秋雲暗幾重

Flowing water washes over my heart;  
The frost-chilled sound of his temple-bell enters the dying notes.  
I had not been aware that in the green hill's dusk  
The autumn clouds had darkened severalfold.
