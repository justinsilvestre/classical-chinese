      Green covers mountain and field; white fills the rivers.
      Among the calls of the cuckoo, the rain is like mist.
      During April in the countryside villages, few are at rest.
      Though we only just finished raising silkworms and planting mulberry, we are still to plant the rice.

  notes: |-
      四月 in the lunar calendar places this poem at the end of spring.
      the basic meaning of 煙 is "smoke", but it's often used like "mist" or "haze". if you imagine the kind of sky that would produce rain so diffuse it appears like a mist, you can see why the rivers would be filled with white--they're reflecting a sky overcast with white clouds.
      the object of the set phrase 插田 is omitted, but context makes it clear we're dealing with a farming village here, and there's one thing they could be sticking into the rice fields--rice seedlings.

# 長安道，人無衣，馬無草，何不歸來山中老
# 黃鳥啼多春日高，紅芳開盡井邊桃。美人手暖裁衣易，片片輕雲落剪刀。
# 水有青蓮沙有金，老僧於此獨觀心。愁人欲寄中峰宿，只恐白猿啼夜深。
