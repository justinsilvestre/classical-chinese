(Giles)\n\nKuo fêng, the manners and customs of the States, is the title of the first section of the Book of Poetry. It is so called because it was customary for the various rulers of the Feudal States to forward to their suzerain, 天子 t'ien tzŭ the Son of Heaven, such ballads as were commonly sung by the people under their jurisdiction. These were then submitted to the Imperial Musicians, who were able to judge from their nature of the manners and customs prevailing in the various States, and the suzerain was thus enlightened as to the administration of his vassal Princes.

(Giles)\n\nThe [resignation] reference is to the six-year-old son of the last Emperor of the Later Chou dynasty, who resigned in A.D. 960 in favour of the founder of the Sung dynasty. (Giles)\n\nThe Sung dynasty was interrupted in A.D. 1127 by the 金 Chin Tartars, who had been called in to exterminate the 遼 Liao Tartars, carrying off the Emperor and his heir and occupying the northern portion of the empire. Another son of the unfortunate monarch succeeded in re-establishing the line, and for greater security transferred his capital southwards to modern Hangchow. Hence the first period was called the Northern, the latter the Southern, Sung; and it is to the final reunion of the two under the Mongol Emperor Kublai Khan in A.D. 1260 that this line refers, although the last representative of the Sungs lived on until 1279.
